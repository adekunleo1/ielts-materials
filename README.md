## # ***Importance of Soil in an Organic Agriculture***

If soil is healthy, it is a living entity teeming with life such as worms, fungi and bacteria. If plants are grown in poor soil, they will lack nutrients and human health will suffer. Plants are nourished by organic matter, minerals and other essential elements which are broken down by insects and other organisms in a synergistic relationship.

</p>

The chart shows the percentage of paper & cardboard, glass containers, aluminum cans and plastics that were recycled in one country between 1982 and 2010.

In 1982, about 65% of paper and cardboard was recycled. This figure fluctuated before rising steeply to reach a peak 80% in 1994. From then on, however, it decreased steadily to a level of 70% in 2010. In 1982, half of all glass containers were recycled; after dipping to a low of 40% in 1990, the glass recycling rate gradually increased to 60% by 2010.

Aluminum cans were first recycled in 1986, starting at about 5%, but this figure climbed rapidly over 25 years and by 2010 it had reached 45%. Recycling of plastics, on the other hand, was not introduced until 1990 and, although the growth in this category was also constant, it was very slow, rising from about 2% to around 8% over the period.

Overall, the proportion of paper and cardboard that was recycled was the highest of the four class of material, but this category experienced a decline after 1994, whereas there was a continuing upward trend in the recycling of the other materials.

## Q. ***Learning english at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught many are at risk of dying out. In Your Opinion, is it important for everyone to learn english? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and if so, how?***

Over the recent years, globalization has led to the free exchange of ideas and cultures. This inturn led to an extensive use of english as a **lingua franca**. In todays world learning this language is mandatory to succeed in life. At the same time local languages have to be preserved.

To begin with, the usage of as a bridge language desirable as it enhances cross cultural communication. These days job opportunities are various for people who are proficient in this language as this is the language of business. Most of the multinational companies open their branches across the world and mostly people who are well versed with english language are provided with high paid job. Apart from that if a country is to become competent in any field it is imperative for it to learn english. Succeeding in life is seldom seen without this.

Furthermore, it embodies a clear accessible standard for everybody to follow be it in books, movies or the internet. Most of the books, movies and magazines published in the world are in english. This is the language of technology, science, medicine, industry and education.

However, the decreased use of local language would lead to its death and language death means loss of culture. Culture forms language and language resolves around culture, the of one means the same for the other. Government must take appropriate action to protect their language from **extinction**. Appropriate legislation should be made and government must provide **adequate** funds for local language training institutions. Additionally individuals should continue using their mother langue.

To conclude, while proficiency in english is a much needed aspect to lead a successful life, one should also take pride in learning their local languages which is mandatory for the survival of these languages.
