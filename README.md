## # ***Importance of Soil in an Organic Agriculture***

If soil is healthy, it is a living entity teeming with life such as worms, fungi and bacteria. If plants are grown in poor soil, they will lack nutrients and human health will suffer. Plants are nourished by organic matter, minerals and other essential elements which are broken down by insects and other organisms in a synergistic relationship.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/recycling_materials_proportion.png" alt="RECYCLING MATERIALS PROPORTION" width="600px" />
</p>

The given line graph shows the recycling rate for four different materials during the period from 1982 to 2010 in a particular country. It is evident that paper & cardboard is the most recycled material. About 65 percent of paper & cardboard was recycled in 1982. The recycling of these materials reached their peak value of 80 percent in 1994. From then onwards, there was a steady decline in the amount of paper & cardboard recycled.

Glass containers are the second most recycled material. While in 1982 about 50% of glass containers were recycled, that figure rose to 60% in 2010. The recycling of aluminum cans started in 1984. While only about 5 percent of aluminum cans were recycled in that year that figure rose steadily to 45 percent in 2010.

Plastic is the least recycled material. The recycling of plastic started around 1988. However, there has only been a small increase in the amount of plastic recycled over the years.

## Q. ***Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and, if so, how?***

Over the recent years, globalization has led to the free exchange of ideas and cultures. This inturn led to an extensive use of english as a **lingua franca**. In todays world learning this language is mandatory to succeed in life. At the same time local languages have to be preserved.

To begin with, the usage of as a bridge language desirable as it enhances cross cultural communication. These days job opportunities are various for people who are proficient in this language as this is the language of business. Most of the multinational companies open their branches across the world and mostly people who are well versed with english language are provided with high paid job. Apart from that if a country is to become competent in any field it is imperative for it to learn english. Succeeding in life is seldom seen without this.

Furthermore, it embodies a clear accessible standard for everybody to follow be it in books, movies or the internet. Most of the books, movies and magazines published in the world are in english. This is the language of technology, science, medicine, industry and education.

However, the decreased use of local language would lead to its death and language death means loss of culture. Culture forms language and language resolves around culture, the of one means the same for the other. Government must take appropriate action to protect their language from **extinction**. Appropriate legislation should be made and government must provide **adequate** funds for local language training institutions. Additionally individuals should continue using their mother langue.

To conclude, while proficiency in english is a much needed aspect to lead a successful life, one should also take pride in learning their local languages which is mandatory for the survival of these languages.

## Q. ***Some people think that having a set retirement age (e.g. 65 years) for everybody, regardless of occupation is unfair. They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age. Do you agree or disagree? Which type of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?***

Since the inception of human civilization, the debate over the retirement age is widespread. Although people usually continue working after retirement, in most countries retirement is regulated. Some countries, with huge youth workforce, allow their citizens to retire early as 50. Similarly, countries that struggle with lack of workforce allow people to work more than 60 as 65 or 70 too.  However, there are few occupations which demand exceptions over age limits. For example: in politics, people work with no age limit as this occupation is paramount and requires significantly long and skilled experience and in the military, servicemen are allowed to actively serve till 45 years only as the job  necessitates impeccable physical fitness and dynamic adaptability.

Firstly, countries with huge youth workforce have enacted rules to force an average worker to end their careers early at an age of 50.  Eminently, this decision is influenced by the requirement to engage maximum workforce to employment. Moreover, youth bring extra energy and new innovative ideas to turn jobs more productive and less costly. However, even in these countries, we find retired people working as freelancers after retirement as early retirement for most is not a rewarding experience, and in most cases, early retirement does not suffice all monetary requirements. For example: officially, China, a country with the largest youth and overall population, does not allow its citizens to work after 50.

Secondly, some countries like Poland, Iceland etc. allow their citizens to work till 70 as these countries are enduring with low workforce and high ageing people, who hold a major share of the population.  Obviously, this has some repercussions over the productivity. But, many people support this idea as this allows them to muster enough money and resources to spend happy and independent life afterwards. For example, Austria,  a country with the highest share of senior citizens, allow people to work till 70, and in order to tackle the issue, the country has announced a skilled migration scheme to attract skilled workers from other countries.

In conclusion, I believe that a retirement age should be selected after intensive research into a country\'s job market, population ratio and other factors impacting society. Also, certain occupations must be vetted differently as they required some specific skills. For example, politicians must not be barred after any age, and similarly, servicemen must get retired after 50.

## Q. ***Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?***

Solar power as a source of domestic household energy is becoming more desirable because many individuals are concerned that burning fossil fuels adds carbon to the atmosphere and thus accelerates global warming and climate change. Carbon emitted in the atmosphere from burning fuels has turned people to use alternative sources of energy. They have found that solar power has many benefits and fewer drawbacks.

To begin with, the main advantage of solar energy is that after the initial installation, it is entirely free and renewable. Hence, there are no extra costs involved in producing the energy which is never going to expire. Individuals will continue to get solar energy as long as the Sun is there. Moreover, it is silent and environmentally friendly as well it does not destroy and poison the ecosystem. This is because the raw material -sunshine- does not need to be extracted. It has the capability to produce power in remote areas that are not necessarily connected to a power grid. A prime example of this is in space, where satellites are controlled by high productivity solar cells. The establishment of solar panels in remote areas is substantially more financially savvy than laying expensive voltage wires.

However, the greatest disadvantage of solar power is that it is totally reliant on sunlight, which is not always constant. In fact, there are some places where it may not be practicable for example Sweden, Norway, and Alaska. In addition, the panels are big and cumbersome requiring a larger place to be set up even the initial purchase. And installation of the equipment is expensive

To conclude, the benefits of a clean, quiet, and eco-friendly source of energy far outweigh the drawbacks, assisting secure natural resources for posterity.

|Words used    | Meaning                   |
|--------------|---------------------------|
|Cumbersome    |difficult to handle or use |
|Feasible      |practicable, possible      |

## Q. ***It is generally accepted that exercise is good for children and teenagers. Therefore, physical education and sport should be compulsory for all students in all schools. What do you think? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.***

According to a large number of people, exercise is good for young children and teenagers. Hence, schools should make physical education and sports mandatory for all students. In my opinion, I completely agree with this idea of giving importance to physical education and sport in the school curriculum.

To start with, exercise is the key to physical and mental health. It keeps the body of a child active and brings enthusiasm in him to complete other activities during the day. As most of the physical exercises are done in open grounds, they give young people a chance to connect with the nature. In addition, youngsters who play sports on a regular basis learn to accept success and defeat gracefully. These players get to compare their performance with each other and get encouraged to perform better. Team spirit is also one of the major benefits of playing sports which includes team participation.

Moreover, these exercises and sports help children to fight their sedentary lifestyle. For example, a child who has a sports competition next week will practice his skills at home as well. It also encourages the parents to spend their time with their children to train them for the league. This makes the entire family shift towards a healthy lifestyle that consists of regular physical exercise. Introducing exercise in the school timetable helps students to get a break from the exhaustive academic subjects and return to it with renewed interest. A student who is not very strong at academics gets a wonderful opportunity to build her career in sports if these sports are taught at school.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of making physical exercise and sports compulsory in primary and secondary learning institutions because sports benefit the overall growth and development of children.

|Words used    | Meaning                   |
|--------------|---------------------------|
|Sedentary     |Requiring sitting or little activity |

## Q. ***Rising university fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy and history and only offer practical degree courses that maximise chances of employment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?***

Owing to the rising unemployment and increasing cost of university education, it is considered by many people that subjects, such as philosophy and history, should be excluded from the curriculum and in order to increase job prospects, only practical subjects should be taught. In my opinion, even though practical subjects increase the chances of employment, art subjects have their own importance in contributing to the growth of an individual and the society/nation.

Arts subjects are crucial for the growth of the individual. This is primarily because many individuals are passionate about studying these subjects. By studying them, people are able to understand the human behavior. As a result, they would know the causes behind the unethical behavior of the humans. This would enable them to be creative and come up with the innovative ideas to avoid such behavior and make the world a better place to live in. Thus, these subjects would enhance the thinking ability of the individuals.

However, diminishing employment opportunities and increased university fees have made professional courses more viable options.  By teaching practical subjects, such as accountancy and law, job prospects would increase for an individual. This is mainly because employers prefer a candidate fully equipped with the practical knowledge. For instance, multinational companies shortlist only those candidates who can prepare the financial statements which require accountancy skills. Once people find jobs, the unemployment rate comes down and the nation progresses. It is apparent / obvious that the demand for practical/professional courses is at an all time high.

To conclude, practical subjects, no doubt, increase job opportunities for the people and help them with their daily needs. Art subjects, however, are also crucial for the development of the individual and the society. Hence, in my opinion, universities should offer both types of courses.
