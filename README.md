## # ***Importance of Soil in an Organic Agriculture***

If soil is healthy, it is a living entity teeming with life such as worms, fungi and bacteria. If plants are grown in poor soil, they will lack nutrients and human health will suffer. Plants are nourished by organic matter, minerals and other essential elements which are broken down by insects and other organisms in a synergistic relationship.
