# Line graph

Line graph show numbers changing over a period of time.

You won't see a graph with only one line.

Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

1. Make a very general comparison (summary/overview paragraph)

2. Compare the lines at specific points (Details paragraph)

   Write at least one thing about each line.

## Introduction - paraphrase the question

> The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

This line graph compares `the amount of electricity produced` in France using four different `sources of` power **over a period of** 32 years.

## Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

It is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important** means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables `provided` the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

## Details - 2 paragraph, compare the lines

In 1980, *thermal* power stations were the main `source of` electricity in France, `generating` around 120 terawatt hours of power. *Nuclear* and *hydroelectric* power stations `produced` just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and *renewables* `provided` a **negligible amount**. Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power **as the primary source of** electricity.

```
You can't write:
- Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

You must write:
- Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electrivity.
```

## Details for each line

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from *nuclear* power **rose dramatically to a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure for** *thermal* power **fell** to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level** for the rest of the period. *Hydroelectric* power generation **remained relatively stable**, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but *renewable* electricity production **saw only a small rise** to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
