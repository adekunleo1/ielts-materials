# Task 2

## Steps

10 min: Topic --> key things --> structure --> option --> vocabulary

5 min: Introduction

20 min: Two main body paragraphs

5 min: Conclusion

## Introduction

### Question analysis

- General topic
- Specific key words
- Instruction words

### Idea generation

- Keep it simple
- The simplest, most straightforward answer is the best

### Paraphrasing

- State the same ideas but use different words. How would you say in your own words?
- We can do this by using synonyms
- We can do this by changing the structure of the sentence.

### Briefly answer questions

### Put all together

## Main body

Using your introduction to as a 'Mini-Plan'

### Topic sentence

- Tell the reader what the paragraph is about
- Short and simple. Does not need to be a complex sentence

### Explanation

- Think of explanations as reasons why you believe your main idea or why you think your main idea is correct.
- You are providing the reader with a reasoned argument



- So what ?!
- How would you explain this to someone who knows nothing about the topic
- How would you convince someone?
- Put yourself in someone else's shoes

### Example

- The strongest arguments have proof
- Examples do not need to be 'true' but they must make sense
- However, it is best if they are true



If you can't think of a 'real example', you could use one of the following two ways:

- Recent research concluded that .... + what you are trying to prove
- A recent study found that ... + what you are trying to prove

## Conclusion

### Cohesive device

- In conclusion
- To conclude

### Reiterate opinion

- We take our opinion from the introduction and we paraphrase it

- Someone should be able to read your conclusion only and tell you what your main ideas are

## Common introductions

## Bands

Depending on what scores my students are aiming for, I give different advice.

**If you are aiming for band 5, 5.5 or 6:**

You can reach band 6 with fairly 'easy' language if your essay **structure** is good, your ideas are **relevant** to the question topic, and you write at least 250 words. Look through the writing task 2 lessons on this website to learn how to write introductions, main paragraphs and conclusions, and work on writing short, simple sentences to express your ideas.

When people get band 5 or below, it is often because they **don't finish** their essays, they go **off-topic**, they have no idea about good essay structure, or they try to use 'difficult' language and therefore make lots of mistakes. For bands 5 to 6, keep your essays simple and clear.

**If you are aiming for band 7 or higher:**

First, you need to do everything that I mentioned above: you need relevant ideas, a good essay structure, and you must write at least 250 words.

But to reach the higher scores, your essays need more '**depth**'. You need to explain your ideas in more detail, using a wider range of vocabulary. At this level, [good essay structure is not enough](https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/07/ielts-writing-task-2-structure-is-not-the-secret.html), and memorised linking phrases won't help either. Your focus should be on [real content](https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-focus-on-real-content.html).

## Experiences
