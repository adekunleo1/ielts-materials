### Firstly, Secondly, Finally

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

3-minute plan:

- disagree for several reasons
- school timetable is full, no time for community service
- students' work in other subjects would be affected
- teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation)

There are several reasons why I would argue against having *compulsory community service* for secondary school students. **Firstly**, the *school curriculum* is already full with important *academic subjects*, such as maths, science and languages. **For example**, I remember having an *extremely busy timetable* when I was at high school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. **Secondly**, *students’ performance* in other subjects would be affected if *valuable study time* were taken by *charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes*. **Finally**, I believe that teenage students would be *reluctant* to take part in any programme of *obligatory work*, and this could lead to *poor motivation* and even bad behaviour.

### Idea, Explain, Example

3-minute plan:

- voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive
- students more motivated if they can choose
- gain work experience, self confidence, skills
- good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers

**On the other hand**, the *opportunity* to do *voluntary community service* could be extremely positive for high school students. By making **these programmes** optional, schools would *ensure that only motivated students took part*. **These young people** would *gain valuable experience in* an *adult working environment*, which could help to *build* **their** *self confidenc*e and *enhance their skills*. Having **such experience and skills** on their CVs could greatly improve *school leavers’ career prospects*. **For example**, a period of voluntary work experience might *impress a university admissions officer or a future employer*.
