# Introductions

Method:

2 sentences

- introduce the topic
- give a general answer

Four types of questions:

- Discussion
- Opinion
- Problem and solution
- Two-part question

### Discussion

> Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Plan:

Topic - study in groups or alone

Answer - sometimes better alone, usually better in a group

People **have different views about** the effectiveness of group study **as opposed to** working alone. **While** there are some **benefits to** studying independently, **I believe that** group work is usually more productive.

### Opinion

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Plan:

Topic - community service for all teenagers

Answer - 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible)

It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities.

agree: I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a
good idea.

disagree: my opinion, it would be wrong to **force** teenagers to do any kind of **unsalaried** work.

balanced: **While** I **disagree** with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, I **do believe that** voluntary community service could benefit young people.

### Problem and solution

> Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?

Plan:

Topic - criminal reoffend

Answer - several reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities)

**It is true that** punishments do not always **deter** criminals
from committing more crimes. **There are various reasons why** offenders repeatedly **break the law**, but governments could certainly **take steps to address** this issue.

### Two-part question

> As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?

Plan:

Topic - job satisfaction

Answer - several factors, unrealistic / impossible

Work **plays a central role in** our lives, and we would all like to feel **fulfilled** professionally. **While** a variety of factors may **lead to** job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.
