## Introduction

Plan:

Topic - student behaviour in schoold

Answer - variety of reasons, steps can be taken to tackle the problem

**It is true that** the behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. **There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can**
**definitely be taken to tackle the problem.**

## Paragraph 2

> Causes of bad student behaviour

**In my opinion, three main factors are to blame for** the way young people behave at school nowadays.

> parents not strict (too lenient)

**Firstly,** modern parents tend to be too *lenient or permissive*.

> children don't accept teachers' instructions

Many children become *accustomed* to getting whatever they want, and they find it difficult to *accept the demands of* teachers or the *limits imposed on* them by school rules.

> teachers' fault. no control, bad classroom management

Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools.

> influence of celebrities who are a bad example

Finally, children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities, many of whom set the example that success can be achieved without finishing school.

## Paragraph 3

> My suggested solutions

Student behaviour can certainly be improved.

> parents set rules for children

**I believe that** the change must **start** with parents, who need to be *persuaded* that it is important to set firm rules for their children.

> use punishments, actions have consequences

When children misbehave or *break the rules*, parents should use r*easonable punishments* to *demonstrate* that actions have consequences.

> schools train teachers and parents, discipline techniques, better communication

**Also,** schools could *play an important role in* training both teachers and parents to use effective *disciplinary techniques*, and in improving the *communication between* both groups.

> famous people act as role models

**At the same time,** famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have to act as role models to children.

## Conclusion

> summarise the problem and steps

**In conclusion,** schools will continue to face discipline problems unless parents, teachers and public figures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.
