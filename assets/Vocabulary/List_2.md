## 1. rot

```
To rot is to decompose, or break down into smaller parts. When old food at the back of your refrigerator rots, you should throw it away.
Sometimes you can tell when something is beginning to rot because it smells bad. But the process that occurs when things rot is a natural one that you can see all around you as you walk through the woods or along the beach. Living organisms have to rot after they die, to make room for more organisms.
```

*Verb*

1. to decay by a gradual natural process, or to make something do this

   ```
   The trees were cut and left to rot.
   ```

   **rot away**

   ```
   All the woodwork was rotting away.
   ```

2. rot in hell/jail

   to suffer or be punished for a long time – used especially when you are angry with someone

   ```
    hope the people who did this rot in hell
   ```

*Noun*

## 2. flawed

```
Things that are flawed are less than perfect. A flawed dinner plate might have a small chip in it, and a flawed English paper includes at least one mistake.
Flawed objects have some kind of imperfection — a dent or a blemish. No one's perfect, so everyone is flawed in some way, but when this word describes a person it often means "weak in character."A Shakespearian flawed hero has some flaw or foible that will ultimately be his undoing: in other words, a "fatal flaw." Flawed comes from flaw, originally "a flake of snow," later "a splinter," and finally "an imperfection."
```

**fatally/fundamentally/deeply etc flawed**

```
The research behind this report is seriously flawed
The process and product of President Donald Trump’s policy on Afghanistan is deeply flawed
```

## 3. raze

```
Raze means to tear an object down to the ground. Before Donald Trump can raze that family's home to build another skyscraper, he's going to have to cut them a big check.
Raze is most often used to refer to knocking buildings down for construction projects, but it can also describe tearing down other objects. You can raze the sand dunes in order to make the beach perfectly flat. Raze comes from the word rasen, meaning "to scrape or erase," and it sounds similar to the word erase, which can help you remember its meaning. If you raze something, in a way it has been erased — it no longer exists in its previous form
```

```
Also under consideration is razing existing camps for the homeless, two officials said.
```

## 4. sequestered /səˈkwestəd/

```
a sequestered place is quiet and far away from people
```

## 5. vandalism /ˈvændəl-ɪzəm/

```
Vandalism is the destruction of someone else's property. Some people think of graffiti as public art, while others dismiss it as nothing but vandalism.
```

## 6. graffiti /ɡræˈfiːti/

```
Graffiti is a word, phrase, or image painted or drawn somewhere in public, like on the side of a building or on the walls in a restroom.
Art or vandalism? That’s the debate about graffiti. For some people, graffiti looks ugly and damages the property where it’s left. Others consider graffiti a form of self-expression and a celebration of public spaces. The word comes from the Italian graffito, which means “a scratch,” and like a deep scratch, graffiti can be difficult to remove. It’s also difficult to spell, but remember that there are two fs and only one t and you’ll get it right every time.
```

## 7. spurn

```
If you reject your mother's offer to buy you a pair of lederhosen with a snort and eye roll, you are spurning her generosity. To spurn means to reject with disdain.
Originally, to spurn was to kick away. Though it's not used in that context so often anymore, being spurned still feels like a kick in the gut. You can reject someone kindly, or let them down easily, but you can't spurn someone with anything but malice.
```

## 8. contingent /kənˈtɪndʒənt/

```
The adjective contingent can be used to describe when something can occur only when something else does first. Making money is contingent on finding a good-paying job.
When something is contingent it means that the possibility of an event or situation depends on another happening or being true first. For example, sometimes people want to buy a new house but they make the purchase of the house they want to buy contingent upon someone else buying their old house first. That way they don't end up owning two houses.
```

*Adjective*

**contingent on/upon**

```
Conservatives prefer a system where men's freedom is contingent on women's servitude.
```

*Noun*

a group of people who all have something in common, such as their nationality, beliefs etc, and who are part of a larger group

```
The largest contingent is from China with 79 exhibitors.
```

## 9. earmark

```
To earmark something is to set it aside for a specific purpose. If you’re saving money to spend it in a particular way — whether it’s for college or a fancy new pair of shoes — you have earmarked that money.
Originally, an earmark was a mark on the ear of an animal — such as a sheep — that indicated ownership. Similarly, when government officials earmark a resource, they're indicating what the resource will be used for. Earmarking is usually about money. $10,000 could be earmarked for cancer research. A grant could be earmarked for a children's hospital. Earmarking is a way of stating how something will be used.
```

## 10. combat

```
Combat is fighting between two groups of armed forces. When you engage in combat, typically this means you engage in fighting that involves weapons.
Combat comes from the Latin com- meaning "together with" and battere meaning "to fight." Combat can be used as a modifier; for example, a combat zone is an area where fighting is taking place. The word combat can also be used to refer to the action of fighting against something to prevent it. An after-school program for kids is working to combat the issue of street violence by creating a safe space where kids can go as an alternative.
```

## 11. scorch

```
To scorch is to burn something fiercely, to the point where its surface — your face, prairie grass, a steak on the grill — chars or otherwise changes color.
Although scorch usually refers to burning something (whether it's the sun or a blowtorch doing the burning), that's not always the case. An army can scorch an enemy territory — meaning raze everything in sight, without technically setting it on fire. Scorch can also mean to quickly overpower something or somebody, as in: "We're gonna scorch the other team tomorrow."
```

1. if you scorch something, or if it scorches, its surface burns slightly and changes colour

   ```
   The walls had been blackened and scorched by fire.
   ```

2. if strong heat scorches you, it burns you

   ```
   The hot sand scorched our feet.
   ```

3. to travel extremely fast

   **scorch along/down/across etc**

   ```

   ```

## 12. tactic

```
Tactic is another word for maneuver or method. Looking for a way to get something done? Then you better find a tactic.
English-speakers have been talking about tactics since at least 1640, when this word was first recorded. A tactic is just a way to do something, a plan, or an approach. Generals have to have a good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics to keep the other guys from scoring. One time-tested tactic for winning over a teacher? Always turn your homework in on time!
```

```
a tactic employed to speed up the peace process
```

## 13. plight

```
A plight is a situation that's hard to get out of. Learning about the plight of very poor people trying to rebuild their homes after a devastating earthquake might inspire you to send money to a charity.
Plight means predicament. It comes from the word for pleat, which means fold. A plight is a tough bind. You'll usually hear the word plight for groups of people or animals struggling to survive, or struggling for better lives. We talk about the plight of refugees, or the plight of sea birds after an oil spill. An old-fashioned use of plight is for pledge. If you get engaged, you give a plight of your love.
```

```
The writer doesn’t want his reader to miss that the animal’s plight is no different from the migrant’s.
```

## 14. refugee /ˌrefjʊˈdʒiː/

```
A refugee is someone who has left a dangerous place for a less dangerous place. You could help refugees from a hurricane by bringing them food and blankets.
Refuge means shelter. So a refugee is a person that seeks shelter, usually from war, natural disaster, or some other harmful situation. If you see the conditions inside a refugee camp, you will realize how hard the lives of the refugees must have been before leaving home
```

## 15. refuge /ˈrefjuːdʒ/

```
To take refuge is to find a safe place. You might take refuge under a bridge in a hail storm, or in a basement during a tornado.
Refuge comes from a French word meaning "to flee," and, in most cases, a refuge is a place to flee to in order to get away from people or places that are unsafe. A refuge is a safe place, such as a building or even another country, as in "they sought refuge from the war by leaving their homeland," or it is a simple, personal place of comfort — like a friend's couch
```

   **take/seek refuge (in something)**

   ```

## 16. predicament /prɪˈdɪkəmənt/

```
If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.
The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means "a state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant state of being.
```

**in a predicament**

```
Other married couples are in a similar predicament.
```

## 17. perch

```
A perch is a temporary resting place. In the middle of climbing a tree, you might find a good perch on a high branch. Bet some birds will be perching there too.
Perch has many different meanings. A bird perch is a little stick it can balance on, and the armrest of the couch can offer you a perch during a party. It's also the name of a kind of fish with spiny fins. And it's also an old measurement of 16.5 feet.
```

1. a branch or stick where a bird sits

   ```

## 18. stilt /stɪlt/

```
Stilts are walking devices that make the person wearing them much taller than usual. When you use stilts, you stand on foot rests and walk along far above the ground.
Stilts are special poles, either for walking tall or for supporting a structure that might otherwise be damaged by water. You can sometimes see people walking on stilts at a circus or parade, and you can see houses on stilts in some beachfront communities. Walking stilts are sometimes also used by workers, including the stilts worn by window washers and fruit farmers.

```

```

## 34. abrupt /əˈbrʌpt/

```
An abrupt decision is one you make suddenly. An abrupt halt is one the Road Runner comes to when reaching an abrupt drop-off—you'd hear brakes squealing.
Because being abrupt with someone is often a way of showing them that you are angry, you often apologize for the appearance of it. "I'm sorry I was abrupt. I was rushing to get to class." The root of abrupt is Latin rumpere "to break," which also gives us rupture "break" and interrupt "break into."
```

1. sudden and unexpected

   ```
   an abrupt change of plan
   ```

   **come to an abrupt end/halt etc**

   ```

   **accommodate to**

   ```

   ```

## 37. acquaint /əˈkweɪnt/ -> acquaintance

作为及物动词，是“使某人熟悉某事物”，不是“自己熟悉”。而且是个瞬时动态动词。“自己去熟悉”就应该加个直接宾语oneself，熟悉什么，用介词with引入。

【例如】I'll acquaint you with the facts. 我将要把情况向您介绍。/ I had acquainted myself with their customs. 我了解了他们的风俗习惯。

但是acquaint somebody with后面只能是事情，不能是人。如果是人，acquaint要变换一下，成为make 
somebody acquainted with somebody else。

【例如】I'd like to make you acquainted with my brother. 我愿让您认识一下我哥哥。

无论是acquaint或是make... acquainted，都是瞬时动态动词，表示“从不熟悉到熟悉”的瞬时变化。

但to be acquainted则通常不指瞬时变化，而是个延续状态动词，指无限延续的“熟悉”状态，with后面是人或是事物均可。

## 38. acute

```
Use the adjective acute for when you want to describe something as sharp or extremely serious.
The word acute is one word; it's not two words, nor does it have anything to do with something small, cuddly, and pretty! Acute really means "sharp" or "severe" or "intense" and modifies certain kinds of angles in geometry or describes a certain kind of illness of short duration. The English word apparently entered the language during the sixteenth century from the Latin root acutus, which means "sharp" or "pointed.".
```

## 39. adhere /ədˈhɪə/

```
If you don't want monkey droppings to adhere to the sole of your shoe, watch where you’re walking. Maybe if you'd adhere, or stick to, the zoo rules and stay on the walking path, you wouldn't have to worry about it.
Adhere is from the 15th-century French verb meaning "to stick." 
```

 to stick firmly to something

**adhere to**

```
The eggs of these fish adhere to plant leaves.
We adhere to the principles of equal rights and freedom of expression for all.

   ```

2. conditions that make it difficult for something to happen or exist

   ```

**adverse / averse**

*Adverse* and *averse* are both turn-offs, but  *adverse* is something harmful, and *averse* is a strong feeling of  dislike. Rainstorms can cause *adverse* conditions, and many people are  *averse* to rain. 

*Adverse* describes something that works against you, like a  tornado or a computer crash, and is usually applied to things. **It's often followed by the word *effects***:

```
More significantly, he has shown that if such ageing cells are  selectively destroyed, these adverse effects go away.
```

*Averse* is usually applied to feelings, attitudes, or people.  It's a strong feeling of opposition — it's a big "no thanks" and **it's often  followed by *to***. *Averse* also goes with *risk* to describe  people (or banks) who don't like taking them:

```
Nevertheless, Ms. Fishbein is not averse to a large sociable  gathering.
```

## 41. aesthetic /iːsˈθetɪk/

```
The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.
```

## 42. affiliate /əˈfɪliət/

```
An affiliate is a subordinate group or organization associated with a larger group or organization. For example, the American broadcasting company NBC has hundreds of affiliate stations around the country.
Affiliate comes from the Medieval Latin term affiliat, meaning "adopted as a son," though it's unlikely NBC sees its affiliate companies in quite that way. The word can also be used to describe someone who simply hangs out with someone else a lot, or keeps company with them regularly, whether for business or not.
```

```

## 44. alienate /ˈeɪliəneɪt/

He felt that his experiences had alienated him from society.
```

## 45. alleviate /əˈliːvieɪt/

```
Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to alleviate, or relieve, your pain.
The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis "light" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate — both words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger.
```

to make something less painful or difficult to deal with

**alleviate the problem/situation/suffering etc**

```
a new medicine to alleviate the symptoms of flu
```

## 46. analogy /əˈnælədʒi/

```

analogies between human and animal behaviour
```

**draw/make an analogy** (=make a comparison)

```
Your apparatus is the collective equipment you use for specific purposes. For example, the apparatus used for scuba diving includes goggles, flippers, and a breathing tank, while a surgeon’s apparatus includes various scalpels and clamps. Different activities, different apparatuses.
The noun apparatus evolved from the Latin apparātus, meaning "equipment or preparation." It might refer to one item, (a breathing apparatus) or a group of items (sports apparatus). Here’s a spelling tip: often, when a word ends in -us, the plural ending changes to i — “alumnus/alumni,” “focus/foci.” However, apparatus is part of the group that doesn't change — words like “virus/viruses” or “census/censuses.” This means the plural is either apparatus or apparatuses, though the latter is more common.
```

1. the set of tools and machines that you use for a particular scientific, medical, or technical purpose 

   ```
   Astronauts have special breathing apparatus.
   ```

   ```


## 49. appease

```
Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in "the cold drink appeased his thirst."
Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, "to pacify, make peace, or be reconciled," from the phrase "a paisier," which combines a-, or "to," and pais, "peace," from the Latin pax
```

to make someone less angry or stop them from attacking you by  giving them what they want

```
Basketball fans in China were not appeased, with many airing criticism of the Rockets on Weibo.
```

## 50. appliance

```
An appliance is a tool or device that performs a certain job. Your toaster is an appliance, and so is your dishwasher. Your dog? Not so much.
Most modern homes are full of appliances that perform various useful tasks — or help you perform them. A hairdryer is an appliance that dries your hair, and a television is an appliance that offers hours of mindless entertainment. The earliest meaning of the word was "action of putting into use," from the verb apply, with its Latin root, applicare, which figuratively means "devote oneself to" or "give attention."
```

domestic/household etc appliance

```
There’s plenty of space for all the usual kitchen appliances.
