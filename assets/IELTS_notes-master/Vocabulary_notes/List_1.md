A grain can also be a speck or a particle — the tiniest bit of something. Don't confuse this with another definition of grain, the kind you find in your bread — wheat, oats, alfalfa, and so on. Check out all the grains in the ten-grain bread next time you're in the bakery!

## 7. aggregate
```
It descends from aggregāre ("to cause to flock together" or "to join together"), a Latin verb made up of the prefix ad- (which means "to," and which usually changes to ag- before a g) and greg- or grex (meaning "flock, herd, or group").
Greg- also gave us congregate, gregarious, and segregate.
Aggregate is commonly employed in the phrase "in the aggregate," which means "considered as a whole."
Aggregate also has some specialized senses.
For example, it is used to describe a mass of minerals formed into a rock, and materials like sand or gravel that are used to form concrete, mortar, or plaster.
```
1. the total after a lot of different figures or points have been added together

   **aggregate of**

   ```

   ```
   In the aggregate (=as a group or in total), women outlive men by 7 or more years.
   ```

2. the whole amount

## 8. congregate

```
Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning "together" and gregare, meaning "to gather in a flock."
Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize.
If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together.
```

1. to come together in a group OPP disperse

   ```
   Crowds began to congregate to hear the President’s speech.
   ```

## 9. gregarious /ɡrɪˈɡeəriəs /

```
If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious.
The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks — it's from the Latin word grex, meaning "herd."
Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. 
Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people.
Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.

Zealous is the adjective for the noun zeal "eager partisanship"; the latter has a long e, but zealous has a short one: ZEL-uhs. It can have a slightly negative connotation, and people are sometimes described as "overzealous," meaning they try too hard.

The word cradle comes to us from the Old English word cradol, which meant "little bed or cot." And while it is important to cradle a baby's head when you pick them up out of their cradle, this word isn't all baby talk. Ever heard of ancient Greece? Otherwise known as "the cradle of democracy?"

As "-lode" morphed into "-hood," which meant "state, condition," the meaning of the word also changed to mean support for a person's life.

It took about 300 years before cattle meant "cows."

## 34. amnesty /ˈæmnəsti/

```
Amnesty can mean a pardon for a wrongdoing, or it can also signal a government's willingness to overlook something.
Amnesty sounds a little like "amnesia," and that's because in its more specific sense amnesty means "forgetting."
The government will essentially forget about whatever crime was committed, or whatever horrible things were said.
As part of a truce, amnesty can be granted to opposition forces in civil disputes. Amnesty to illegal aliens means the government will deliberately overlook their illegal entry to the country.
There can also be a period of amnesty when people can turn in something that they would otherwise get in trouble for. "The city offered a period of amnesty for everyone to turn in illegal guns."
```

```
Activists who were involved in crimes of violence will not automatically be granted amnesty.
```

## 35. Recession  /rɪˈseʃən/

```
Jobs being cut? Houses not selling? Everyone talking about the poor sales of everything from cars to bouquets of flowers? That's a recession, a time of economic decline.
Recession comes from the Latin word recessus, meaning "a going back, retreat." Think of all the things that get made and sold in a country. When fewer people buy things, orders for them slow down. The sales "go back" to a lower amount. This is an economic recession. This noun can also describe other kinds of "going back," like the recession of floodwaters that enable people to begin cleaning up their homes that had been filled with water.

A friend's gleeful face tells you she's gotten great news or heard a hilarious joke, and gleeful kids will sometimes even scream with joy. In the 17th century, the alternate adjective gleesome competed with gleeful — both come from an Old English root, gliu, which means "mirth, play, sport," and also "music" and "mockery."

If you belong to a cult that believes that cupcake consumption is the only true path, then you follow the cupcake dogma. Dogma, once adopted, is accepted without question. Go eat cupcakes!
