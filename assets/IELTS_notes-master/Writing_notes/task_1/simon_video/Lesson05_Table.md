# Tables

Tables can show:

- any kind of number
- the same information as a line graph, bar chart or pie chart
- comparisons
- changes over time (increase, decrease)
- a lot of information (too much!)

**A key skill is 'selecting' which information to mention**

Your job is to select, describe and compare the key numbers.

1. Look for main or general features

   (summary/overview paragraph)

2. Describe specific numbers

   (details paragraph)
