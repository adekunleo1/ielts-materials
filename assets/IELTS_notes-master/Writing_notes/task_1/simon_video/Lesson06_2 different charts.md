## 2 different charts

Your job is to select, describe and compare the key numbers.

But you don't need to compare the 2 charts together - you can describe them separately.

1. Look for one main feature in each chart

   (summary/overview paragraph)

2. Describe specific numbers for each chart separately

   ('details' paragraph)
