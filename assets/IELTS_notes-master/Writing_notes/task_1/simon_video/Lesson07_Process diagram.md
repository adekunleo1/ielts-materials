# Process diagram

Process diagram show steps or stages in a process.

Describing a process is completely different from describing a graph, bar chart, pie chart or table.

**Differences:**

- no numbers
- can't compare anything
- can't describe trends (increase, decrease)

So, what can we describe?

- how many steps
- where the process begins and ends
- each step in the process

**Language for process descriptions:**

- **'steps' language**

  - At the first stage in the process
  - The process begins with
  - Secondly, Finally
  - The second step involves
  - Next, then, after that
  - At the following stage

- **passive verbs**

Maps can also show processes.

(2 sentences, 2 main points)

## Details

**At the first stage in** the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals *are mixed* together. **Next**, this mixture *is heated* in a glass furnace at approximately 1500â„ƒ to produce molten glass. The molten glass *can then be* shaped, by blowing, to create **the end products**, **namely** glass containers.

Glass recycling **begins with** the *collection* of used glass products. The *collected* glass is *sorted* according to its colour, **and then** *washed* in order to remove any impurities. **At the fourth stage of** recycling, the glass is *crushed* and *melted*, and the *resulting molten* glass can **finally** be *moulded* to create new items.
