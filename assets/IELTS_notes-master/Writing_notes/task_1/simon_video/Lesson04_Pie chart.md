## Pie charts

Pie charts can show numbers, but they always show percentages.

The full pie is always 100%.

Pie charts can show changes over time (e.g. years).

You job is to compare the percentages (and numbers).

1. Make a very general comparison

   (summary/overview paragraph)

2. Compare specific figures

   (details paragraph)



## Introduction

> The charts below show household spending patterns in two countries between 1980 and 2008.

The pie charts compare five categories of household `**expenditure**` in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

## Overview

It is **noticeable** that the proportion of `spending` on food and drink **fell** in both countries over the 28-year period, **while** spending on utility bills **rose**. Also, UK residents `spent` a **significantly larger** `percentage of their household budgets` on leisure than their New Zealand **counterparts**.

## Details

````
The same information as the overview, but in more detail.
````

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget **went on** *food and drink*, while the **equivalent figure** for a UK home was 23%. **By** 2008, **expenditure on** food and drink **had fallen** by 4% in New Zealand, and by a **full** 10% in the UK. **By contrast**, both countries **saw an increase** in expenditure on *utility bills* for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

*Leisure* activities **accounted for** the highest proportion of UK household `spending` in both years, but only **the third highest proportion** in New Zealand. **In fact**, in 2008, New Zealanders `spent` only **half as much in relative terms** on recreation (17%) **as** UK residents (34%). In both countries, *transport* `costs` and *other* `costs` took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets **respectively**.

- Don't decribe each country separately.
- Don't describe each year separately.
- Compare countries and years together.
- Mention all 5 categories (food & drink etc.)
- Divide the catefories into two groups for the two 'details' paragraphs
- The category called 'Other' is not important.
- Don't write 'Leisure was 34%'
