It is true that genetic engineering is **a key area of** modern scientific research, **with broad implications for** all human societies. While I accept that this field of technology may **have its dangers**, I believe that the benefits of genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks.

**The negative implications of** genetic engineering are often **discussed in terms of two key areas**, which are food production and **the cloning of humans**. **Genetically modified crops** are already being grown, and people are concerned that they may **damage whole ecosystems** as **foods become resistant to diseases and natural predators**. For example, scientists are able to produce a variety of corn that releases a toxin to kill certain insects, but this **intervention** could lead to the disappearance of birds that feed on those insects. In **the human realm,** some people imagine a world in which clones are used to **fight wars** or to **provide body part replacements**. Perhaps cloning could even be used to **bring deceased people back to life**, which would certainly be **a threat to humanity** as we know it.

**A more optimistic prediction**, **and one that I favour**, is that humans will find ways to **mitigate the risks** and use **genetic technologies** in a responsible way. **From the food production perspective**, genetic engineering could be **the solution to famine** in developing countries, if, for instance, crops can be grown more reliably in harsh conditions. **From a medical perspective**, scientists may use genetic engineering to produce **vaccines**, to cure diseases, or to correct a **genetic defect** before a child is born. **If properly regulated**, even cloning can be done in a way that improves lives. For example, the cloning of individual organs, such as a heart or kidney, could be **permitted** for transplant purposes.

In conclusion, **I am convinced that** genetic engineering will **have a positive impact on** our lives, and that **people's fears will be unwarranted**.

## small familiy

*In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large, extended family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?*

It is true that cities **are seeing a rise in** smaller families and **one-person households**, **while** the extended family **is becoming a rarity**. **In my opinion**, this is a negative development.

As families become smaller, **the traditional family support network** is disappearing, and this can **have a negative impact on** children as they grow up. In a **nuclear family** or **single-parent household**, **childcare** becomes an expensive and **stressful part of daily life**. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on **babysitters, nannies and after-school clubs** to take care of younger children, **while** older children may be **left alone** after school and during holidays. **The absence of** adult family members can **mean that** friends, television and the Internet become **the primary influences on** children’s behaviour. **It is no surprise that** **the decline of the extended family** has been linked to a rise in **psychological and behavioural problems** amongst young people.

**The trend towards** people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of **reduced human interaction**. Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss the **highs and lows of daily life**. They **forgo** the constant stimulation and **hustle and bustle** of a large family, and **are left to** their own devices for **extended periods of time**. The **lack of human contact** in the home is necessarily replaced by **passive distractions**, **such as** television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of existence is **associated with** boredom, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even alienation, all of **which** are factors **that** are known to increase the risk of mental illness.

In conclusion, I believe that individuals **thrive** when they are part of larger family groups, and so **it is worrying that** many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units.

## Artificial intelligence

*Some people believe that developments in the field of artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on our lives in the near future. Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.*

People seem to be either excited or worried about the future impact of artificial intelligence. Personally I can understand the two opposing points of view; **I am both fascinated by** developments in artificial intelligence **and apprehensive about** its possible negative effects.

On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology should bring some obvious benefits. Machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can, especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy or calculations using large amounts of data. For example, robots are being developed that can carry out surgical procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars that use sensors and cameras to drive themselves. Such technologies can improve safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these developments, and many others, will steadily improve our quality of life.

On the other hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that artificial intelligence may harm us if we are not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. In the medium term, if intelligent technologies gradually take jobs away from humans, we may find that people become deskilled and lose their sense of purpose in life. A longer term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make decisions without human oversight and without regard for our well-being.

In conclusion, while intelligent machines will no doubt improve our lives in many ways, the potential risks of such technologies should not be ignored.

## Advertising

### Make sentence

#### Positives

Advertising is a key part of **modern business** / industry that employs many people / creates more opportunities for people facing the risk of **unemployment**.

Customers enjoy creative advertisements which inform them about the choices they have.

#### Negatives

**Advertisers** rely on **glamorous** and successful **celebrities** to create a **consumer culture** where the trend keeps changing.

We are encouraged to **associate certain brands with a higher status**.

#### Opinions

Unhealthy food advertising should be **regulated** and should not be **marketed** in a way that attracts children.

However, advertising is necessary in **free market economies**.

### Example

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/10/ielts-writing-task-2-power-of-advertising-essay.html

*Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

**It is true that** we are **increasingly surrounded by** advertising by companies that want to sell us their products. **To some extent I agree that** advertising **has an impact on** sales, **but I would also argue that** we do need most of the goods that we buy.

Advertisements can certainly **tempt** people **to** buy products that they might not otherwise want. A good example could be the mobile phone. Every year people can be seen **queuing** to buy the **latest models**, **even when** they already have a **perfectly good** phone that does not need replacing. **Perhaps** it is the influence of **marketing** that **leads** us **to** **make** these kinds of **decisions**; we want to **stay up to date with the latest fashions or own the newest high-status device**. The high sales of the iPhone **seem to support this idea.**

**On the other hand, I believe that** most people do not buy products because of the advertising alone. There are other good **reasons why** we **make** these **choices**, and there must be **some kind of** need before a person **makes** a **purchase**. New versions of products almost always have **improved features** that buyers may want. A new car**, for example,** **may** have greatly improved **safety features**, or it may be more **economical** to run, or it may pollute less. A new phone **may** allow the user to communicate more quickly or effectively, **thus** **enhancing** their **quality** of life.

In conclusion, **while** advertising obviously influences our buying behaviour, **I do not agree that** people **always** make decisions that **go against** their real needs.

## Animal

### Animal testing

#### Arguments for Animal testing

Many important **medical discoveries** involved experiments on animals and aimed to **minimize the suffering** that animal experiences.

Testing for the **cosmetics industry** is now banned in many countries.

#### Arguments against Animal testing

Humans have no **moral right** to do experiments on animals and animals should be **respected**.

Instead, similar researches can be **conducted** by **alternative methods**, such as compute modeling.

#### Example

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/06/ielts-writing-task-2-animal-testing-essay.html

>  *Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity.*
> *Discuss both views and give your own opinion.*

**It is true that** medicines and other products are **routinely tested** on animals before they are cleared for human use. **While I tend towards the viewpoint that** animal *testing* is **morally** wrong, **I would have to support a limited amount of** animal *experimentation* for the development of medicines.

**On the one hand**, there are *clear* **ethical arguments** **against** animal *experimentation*. To use a common example of this practice, **laboratory mice** may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. **Opponents** of such research *argue* that humans **have no right to** **subject** animals to this kind of **trauma**, and that the lives of all **creatures** should be **respected**. They *believe* that the benefits to humans do not **justify** the suffering caused, and that scientists should use **alternative methods** of research.

**On the other hand**, **reliable alternatives** to animal experimentation *may not always* be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that **a certain amount** of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if **human lives** are saved. They *argue* that opponents of such research *might* feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. **Personally**, I agree with the banning of animal testing for **non-medical** products, but I *feel* that it *may* be a necessary **evil** where new drugs and medical procedures are **concerned**.

In conclusion, i**t seems to me that it would be wrong to** ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/01/ielts-writing-task-2-wild-animals-essay.html

*Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

**Some people argue that** it is **pointless** to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I **completely disagree** with this point of view.

In my opinion, it is **absurd** to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century. **I do not believe that** planet Earth **exists** only **for** **the benefit of** humans, and **there is nothing special about** this particular century that means that we suddenly have the **right** to allow or encourage the **extinction** of any **species**. **Furthermore**, **there is no compelling reason why** we should let animals **die out**. We do not need to **exploit or destroy** every **last square meter of land** in order to **feed or accommodate** the world’s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist **side by side** with wild animals, and this should be our aim.

I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that **ensures** the **survival** of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also **crucial** for human **survival**. For example, **rainforests** produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and **stabilize** the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far **outweigh** the costs of **conservation**. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we **maintain** the **natural balance** of all life on Earth.

In conclusion, we **have no right** to decide **whether or not** wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.

## City

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/03/ielts-writing-task-2-problem-and-solution-essay.html

> *More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?*

Cities are often seen as places of **opportunity**, but there are also some major **drawbacks** of living in a large **metropolis**. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the **average** **inhabitant**.

**The main problem for** anyone who hopes to **migrate** to a large city is that the cost of living is *likely* to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. ***Inhabitants*** of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. **Another issue is that** urban areas *tend to* suffer from **social problems** such as **high crime** and **poverty rates** *in comparison with* rural areas. **Furthermore**, the air quality in cities is *often* poor, *due to* pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually **overcrowded**. **As a result**, city life can be unhealthy and **stressful**.

**However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems.** **Firstly**, they could **invest** money in the building of **affordable** or **social housing** to reduce the cost of living. **Secondly**, **politicians** have the power to ban **vehicles** from city centres and **promote** the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a **congestion** charge for drivers has helped to **curb** the traffic problem. **A third option would be to** develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.

In conclusion, governments could certainly **implement** a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city ***residents***.

## Studying Abroad

***Advantages of studying abroad:***

Many students choose to study abroad because there are **greater opportunities** in a particular foreign country. Foreign universities *may* offer better **facilities** or **courses**. They *may* also be more **prestigious** than universities in the student’s own country and have teachers who are **experts** in their fields. *Therefore*, by studying abroad, students can **expand** their **knowledge** and gain **qualifications** that open the door to better **job opportunities**. A period of study abroad *can also* **broaden students’ horizons**. In the new country, they will *have to* live and work with other students of various **nationalities**. *Thus*, overseas students are exposed to different cultures, customs and points of view.

## Technology

*Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?*

**It is true that** new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, **and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects**.

Technology has had an impact on **relationships in business, education and social life**. **Firstly**, telephones and the Internet **allow** business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. **Secondly**, services like Skype **create new possibilities for** relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. **Finally**, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who **share common interests**, and they interact through their computers **rather than face to face**.

On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. **Cooperation** between people in different countries was much more **difficult** when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new **communication technologies** can also have the result of **isolating people and discouraging real interaction**. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than **mixing with their peers** in the real world, and these **‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships**.

In conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.

## higher education

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-writing-task-2-higher-education.html

*Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.Discuss both views and give your opinion.*

**Introduction** When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.

**Paragraph 1: benefits of getting a job** The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons.
(IDEAS: start earning money, become independent, gain experience, learn skills, get promotions, settle down earlier, afford a house, have a family)

**Paragraph 2: benefits of higher education (my opinion)**On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies.
(IDEAS: some jobs require academic qualifications, better job opportunities, higher salaries, the job market is very competitive, gain knowledge, become a useful member of society)

**Conclusion**
For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.

## Global warming

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/09/ielts-writing-task-2-climate-change-essay.html

*Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

Climate change **represents a major threat to** life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I **completely disagree with** this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.

There are various **measures** that **governments and individuals** could take to prevent, or at least **mitigate**, climate change. Governments could introduce **laws** to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “**green taxes**” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in **renewable energy production** from solar, wind or water power. **As individuals**, we should also try to **limit our contribution to** climate change, by becoming more **energy efficient**, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. **Furthermore**, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who **propose to** tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it.

If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not **optimistic** that we would be able to **cope with** even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to **safeguard** low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to **migrate** to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see **outbreaks of disease and famine**, as well as increased **homelessness and poverty**.

In conclusion, **it is clear to me that** we must **address** the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.

## Recycling

*Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?*

> **Introduction**
> It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take.
>
> **Topic sentence for first main paragraph**
> In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem.
>
> **Topic sentence for second main paragraph**
> However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law.
>
> **Conclusion**
> In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that making recycling a legal requirement is the only way to encourage people to recycle their household waste.

It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. **Although I accept that** new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, **I do not agree that** a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take.

In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments could make it a **legal obligation** for **householders** to separate all waste into different bins. There could be **punishments** for people who fail to **adhere to** this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a **deterrent** and encourage people to **obey** the recycling law. As a result, the improved behavior of homeowners could lead to a clean, **waste-free** environment for everyone.

However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective if politicians **put** education, rather than punishment, **at the center of** a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and **homeowners** could be **informed** about the **environmental impact** of household waste. **Another** **tactic** that governments could use would be to create **stricter regulations** for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. **Finally**, money could also be spent to improve **recycling facilities** and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate it correctly in the home.

In conclusion, **perhaps we do need to** make recycling a legal requirement, **but this would certainly not be the only way to** encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly.

## Nuclear power

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-writing-task-2-nuclear-power-topic.html

There are several benefits to building more nuclear power stations. **Firstly**, nuclear power is a relatively **sustainable** energy source, **meaning that** it can be used to produce electricity without wasting limited natural resources like coal, oil or gas. **Secondly**, nuclear power stations are **cleaner** than fossil fuel power stations, and could help to reduce **carbon emissions** that cause global warming. With improvements in nuclear technology, **the risks of accidents** are being reduced. **As a result**, many countries are now **considering** nuclear power **as a solution to** high oil and gas prices, increasing demand for electricity, and worries about pollution and climate change.

## Gender and university

https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/06/ielts-writing-task-2-gender-and-university-essay.html

*Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

> 1. Introduction: We decided to completely disagree with the question statement. You don't need to explain both sides of the argument. Just give your opinion in the introduction, then support it in the main body paragraphs.
> 2. Paragraph 2: One reason why we decided to disagree is that it would not be practical or realistic to have exactly the same number of males and females on every course. Some courses have mainly male applicants, while others are more popular with females.
> 3. Paragraph 3: Another reason we disagreed is that it would not be fair to base admission to courses on gender. Universities should select candidates based on their qualifications, skills, experience etc.
> 4. Conclusion: Repeat the idea that selecting according to gender is not the best way to ensure equal opportunities for men and women at university.

**In my opinion**, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. **However, I do not agree with the idea of** accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.

Having the same number of *men and women* on all degree courses is simply **unrealistic**. Student numbers on any course depend on the **applications** that the institution receives. If a university decided to **fill** courses **with** equal numbers of *males and females*, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more **popular** with one gender than the other, and it would not be **practical** to aim for equal proportions. For example, **nursing courses** tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.

**Apart from** the practical concerns expressed above, **I also believe that** it would be unfair to **base** admission to university courses **on** gender. Universities should continue to select the best **candidates** for each course according to their **qualifications**. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, **it is surely wrong to** reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.

In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on **merit**, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.

## immigration

**Here is a paragraph giving some of the economic benefits of immigration:**

From an economic perspective, immigration can be extremely positive. Many immigrants have skills that are needed in the country they move to. For example, countries sometimes lack key workers like doctors and nurses, and immigration is therefore encouraged. Immigrants who find work contribute to the economy of their new country with the skills they bring and the taxes they pay. At the same time, many immigrants send money to help family members in their home country, therefore helping to boost that economy too.

## foreign tourists

*Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?*

**It is sometimes argued that** tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. **I completely disagree with** this idea.

**The argument in favour of** higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on **state subsidies** to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the **tax system**. However, I believe this to be a very **shortsighted** view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to **subsidize** important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.

If travelers realized that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular **nation**, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. **To take the UK as an example,** the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s **cultural heritage**. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of **insufficient funding** for the maintenance of these important buildings.

In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be **counterproductive** to make them pay more than local residents.
