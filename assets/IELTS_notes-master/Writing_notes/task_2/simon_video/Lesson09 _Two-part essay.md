## Introduction

Plan:

Topic - decisions about news stories

Answer - variety of factors, yes too much bad news.

It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they *broadcast* or publish, and their choices are *no doubt influenced by* a variety of factors. In
my opinion, we are *exposed to* too much bad news, and I would welcome *a greater emphasis on* good news.

## Paragraph 2

> variety of factors that influence news editors

Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on.

> interest or attract viewers / readers

**Firstly, I imagine that** they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to *choose* their television channel or their newspaper *over* competing providers.

> inform the public, important issues and event, in the public interest

**Secondly**, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritise stories that are in the public interest.

> pressure from owners, promote political views

**Finally**, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.

## Paragraph 3

> accustomed to bad news

It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news.

> war, crime, natural disasters, human suffering

We are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world.

> desensitizes us, cynical about the world

believe that such repeated exposure gradually *desensitises people*, and we become more *cynical* about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it.

> prefer positive news, e.g. medical workders, volunteers, kindness

I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities.

> news to inspire us

This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

## Conclusion

> difficult news choices, more positive

**In conclusion,** it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public service.
