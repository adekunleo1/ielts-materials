## Introduction

Plan:

Topic - government spending

Answer - agree, public services instead of space projects

Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on *space exploration programmes*. **I completely agree with the idea that** these are a waste of money, and that the *funds* should be *allocated* to public services.

## Paragraph 2

> expensive (scientists, facilities, equipment)

**There are several reasons why** space programmes should be *abandoned*. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also *come at a huge cost* to the government. 

> no benefit to normal people, politicians showing power

Secondly, these programmers do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply *vanity projects for politicians*.

> waste of money when projects fail, risk of accidents, deaths

Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest *technological* error can *cost astronauts their lives*.

> e.g. Challenger space shuttle

The Challenger *space shuttle disaster* showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.

## Paragraph 3

> why public service spending is better

I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead.

> cheaper e.g. doctors, teachers polices instead of astronauts

It is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects.

> public services impact on everyone

Furthermore, *public servants* do jobs that *have a positive impact on every member of society*.

> we all use schools, hospitals, police, roads

For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide.

> reduce poverty, better quality of life

**If** *governments reallocated* the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people *could be lifted out of poverty* or *given a better quality of life*.

## Conclusion

> spend on services that benefit us all

**In conclusion, my view is that** governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.
