## Introduction

Plan:

Topic - competition or co-operation?

Answer - benefits of both, co-operation more important

**People have different views about whether** children should be taught to be competitive **or** co-operative. **While** a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, **I believe that** the ability to so-operate is more important.

## Paragraph 2

> motivation

**On the one hand**, competition can be a great source of motivation for children. 

> work harder, be better than other children

When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can *encourage* children to work harder to *outdo* the other pupils in the class.

> self confidence, independent work, faster progress

This kind of healthy *rivalry* may help *build children's self confidences*, while *pushing* them to work *independently* and *progress* more quickly.

> competitive situations when leave school e.g. job interviews

When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews.

> prepared for adult life

It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

## Paragraph 3

> co-operation even more important

**On the other hand**, **it is perhaps even more important to** prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation.

> e.g. at work (teams, follow boss's instructions, help junior staff)

In the workplace, adults are expected to work in teams, follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff.

> collaboration more useful than winning

Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win.

> better attitude for young people

**This is the altitude that I believe** schools should foster in young people.

> working together

Instead of promoting the idea that people are winners or losers, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.

## Conclusion

> accept both views, co-operation better

**In conclusion, I can understand why** people might want to  encourage competitiveness in children, **but it seems to me that** a co-operative attitude is much more desirable in adult life.
