## Improving Your IELTS Fluency Score

fluency and coherence score

- not many hesitations
- stay on topic
- use linking words well.

biggest weakness? (Focus on one thing at a time)

- too many pauses and hesitations
- short answers.
- going off-topic.
- speaking in simple sentences, without using linking words

Choose one topic and record yourself talking about it for one minute. Listen to the recording.

Choose a common IELTS speaking topic. Here are some ideas: free time, food, your hometown, your job, your home, travel, shopping, [music](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/arguing-about-music), technology, or [films and TV](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/learn-english-with-tv-movies).

This isn’t a complete list, but it’s enough to get you started!

**Choose one topic** and **record** yourself talking about it for **one minute**. Listen to the recording.

Next, **check for problems**. For example, if you said your biggest weakness is **hesitating** and pausing, then listen to your recording and count the number of times you pause. Count every time you stop, every time you say ‘um’, ‘er’ or anything like that.

Then, repeat the task, and **try to improve**.

For example, if you’re working on hesitations and pauses, then try to get fewer hesitations and pauses the second time.

If you’re working on giving longer answers, then try to get closer to one minute.

After you improve your answer, set yourself **a new challenge**. For example, you can choose a different topic, or you can try to talk for longer. Try to talk for two minutes without hesitating, or three.

For **linking words**, here’s a simple exercise you can do: write down a list of simple linking words, like this:

- also
- because
- although
- but
- for example

Do the same activity: choose a topic and speak for one minute. Try to use all of the linking words on your list.

Listen to your recording, and cross off the linking words when you use them. If you don’t use them all, try again. If you can use them all, make the task more difficult: **make your list longer, and try to speak for more time.**

## Improving Your IELTS Vocabulary Score

- be able to talk about different topics
- use some less common vocabulary
- use collocations
- use register appropriately
- use paraphrase

### Collocations

‘[Collocations](https://www.thoughtco.com/collocation-examples-1210325)’ are word combinations. For example, think about the word *complex.* What things can be complex?

You could have a *complex situation, a complex question, a complex personality,* or *a complex idea.*

#### Method

Read something in English every day. It can be anything: a news article, a blog post, part of a story… Anything is fine.

In the text, try to find **5-10 new collocations** using **only words you already know**.

For example, imagine that you’re reading a news article and you see the phrase *energy use.*

You already know the words *energy* and *use,* so you learn this collocation.

Next, **look up the word** *energy* in the dictionary, and find **2-3 more collocations**, like:

- energy consumption
- green energy
- conserve energy

Keep track of your new collocations using digital flashcard apps like Quizlet or Anki.

### Register

‘Register’ means whether the language you use is formal or informal. Your goal is to communicate clearly and naturally, not formally.

###paraphrase

‘paraphrase’ means using a range of language to avoid repetition.

> In my free time, I enjoy reading books. Whenever I have free time, I like to read different kinds of books, especially historical fiction or fantasy. I usually have free time at the weekends, so I read books as much as I can.

It’s too repetitive. The candidate uses the words *free time* and *read books* too much.

> In my free time, I enjoy reading books. Whenever I have some time to myself, I like to sit down with a good book, especially historical fiction or fantasy. I don’t have to work at the weekends, which lets me read as much as I want.

## Improving Your IELTS Grammar Score

- use a range of ‘complex grammatical structures’.
- make ‘frequent error-free sentences’.

#### Complex structures

‘Complex structures’ here does not mean that you need to use very formal or academic language, as we mentioned before.

It means that you need to use different verb tenses, sentence structures, conjunctions and so on.

> I prefer Asian food. I like strong flavours and spicy food, so I particularly like Thai food, Indian food, and so on. I’m quite keen on Japanese food as well. I think Indian food is probably my favourite.

To get a higher score, you need to use a wider range of grammar, like this:

> I prefer Asian food, such as Thai, Indian, and so on, **because** **I’ve always been** a big fan of spicy food with strong flavours. I **tried** Japanese food a few weeks ago, and I like it, **although** **I’d** say that Indian food is probably my favourite.

####frequent error-free sentences

- You forget the ‘s’ on 3rd person verbs, so you say ‘she go’ instead of ‘she goes’.
- You forget to use past forms, so you use present verbs to talk about the past.
- You make mistakes with prepositions, like using *at, in* or *on* to talk about time.
- You use *will* to talk about everything in the future, instead of using *going to* or the present continuous when you need to.

Method

First, identify **five common mistakes** which you make.

Next, **choose one mistake to work on**, then choose a topic and record yourself speaking, like you did before.

Choose a topic which **fits the grammar** you’re practicing. For example, if you forget to use past tenses, choose a topic which is about the past.

Then, try again with a different mistake, or a different topic.

## Improving Your IELTS Pronunciation Score

- be easy to understand
- use ‘features of natural speech’.

1. intonation
2. weak forms
3. word stress
4. sentence stress
5. linking

Do you know what these are? If not, find out! 

Next, **choose the point you find most difficult**, and work on that with your teacher.

1. Find English songs, and sing along to them with the lyrics.
2. Find videos or recordings of famous speeches, and try to copy them. This is very good for your intonation and stress.
3. Find **audio sources** in English—podcasts, radio shows, YouTube videos—anything will do! Try to copy what you hear with the same accent. This isn’t because accent matters, but when you copy the accent, you’ll hopefully copy a lot of the natural features as well.

Like everything else, you should first identify which sounds you have problems with.
