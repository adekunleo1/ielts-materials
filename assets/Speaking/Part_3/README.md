# How to Do Part Three of the IELTS Speaking Test

https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/ielts-speaking-exam-part-three

The examiner will ask you some open-ended questions about a topic. The topic is often related to the topic you spoke about in part two.

In part three, the examiners want to see if you can **express your opinions clearly**. They also want to see if you can talk about **more abstract topics,** not just about your own life.

Also, in part three, the examiner can respond to what you say and take the conversation **in different directions**. That means it’s more like a natural conversation than the other parts of the IELTS speaking exam, which follow a script.

The questions in part three are **generally quite simple**. However, you need to be careful; just because the questions are simple, that **doesn’t mean your answers should be simple**. The questions give you an opportunity to speak. You need to use that opportunity.

> Do you think that children do less sport and exercise than in the past?

## Support Your Opinions

The worst answer in part three is a very short answer. Don’t say something like,

> Yes, I agree.

First, try to **give a reason**. For example:

> Yes, I agree. Children have more homework and are under more pressure at school, so they have less time to play sports or do something outside.

Secondly, try to **add an example from your life**. For example:

> Yes, I agree. Children have more homework and are under more pressure at school, so they have less time to play sports or do something outside. For example, when I was younger, I played outside with my friends every day after school. Nowadays, I never see children playing outside.

But, you say, what if I can’t think of examples from my life?

No problem—just make one up! For example:

> My friend Sam and his wife have an 8-year-old daughter. She has to do around two hours of homework every day after school. Of course, this means she’s too tired to go outside or do anything in the evening. When I was eight years old, I hardly had any homework.

Using an imaginary friend as an example can be a very useful idea.

> In a recent survey, researchers discovered that children 30 years ago did five hours of exercise or physical activity every week. Now, the average is just one hour of activity a week.

However, remember that this is only for emergencies, if you can’t think of anything to say—don’t overuse it! It’s always better to use real examples if you can.

## Speculate—Talk About Possibilities

Speculating means talking about something you aren’t sure about.

> Children definitely do less sport and exercise nowadays, but I’m not sure why that is. Maybe it’s because they spend more time online, playing video games and so on.

By saying, “I’m not sure why that is. Maybe it’s because…” you are speculating. You’re talking about something which you don’t know about, and you’re saying what could be true. You’re talking about possibilities.

Speculating is a really useful tool. It lets you **extend** your answer. It lets you use **advanced** language. It also lets you talk about something you don’t know about.

1. use a verb like ***might*, *may*, or *could***. For example:

> I think children might have less free time than in the past.
>
> Parents may not be willing to let children play outside nowadays, especially in big cities.

2. you can use a phrase like ***it’s possible that…*** or ***one possible reason is that…*** For example:

> It’s possible that there aren’t so many parks and other places where children can play sport.
>
> One possible reason is that parents aren’t interested in sport, so they don’t encourage their children to play sport and be active.

3. you can use an **if-sentence**. For example,

> If children have more homework nowadays, of course it’ll be more difficult for them to play sport.
>
> Obviously, if children spend lots of time in front of a screen, they won’t go outside and do something active.

## Show the Other Side of the Argument

Don’t just give your opinion; discuss the opposite opinion too.

Let’s stay with our sample question and answer. To review, you want to agree with the idea that children do less sport now than before.

You start your answer, you give reasons and examples, and you speculate.

Next, discuss the other side of the argument. For example:

> …On the other hand, many of my friends’ children are very active, often more active than their parents. It isn’t true that all children are less active than in the past.
>
> …However, spending time online can also help to get children interested in new sports and activities. It’s much easier to find sports clubs and activities in your local area nowadays, thanks to technology.

This lets you use linking words like ***on the other hand*** or ***however***, and again, this is all making your answer longer and more detailed.

## Summary

You can improve your answer by:

- Adding reasons to support your opinions
- Using examples from your own life
- Speculating (= talking about possibilities, and things you aren’t sure about)
- Discussing the other side of the argument

If you do all this, you can turn a bad answer:

>  Yes, I agree.

Into this:

> Yes, I agree. Children have more homework and are under more pressure at school, so they have less time to play sports or do something outside. For example, when I was younger, I played outside with my friends every day after school. Nowadays, I never see children playing outside. I’m not sure why that is. Maybe it’s because they spend more time online, playing video games and so on. However, spending time online can also help to get children interested in new sports and activities. It’s much easier to find sports clubs and activities in your local area now, thanks to technology.

## Use [Filler Phrases](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/filler-phrases-video-lesson) to Give Yourself Thinking Time

If you need a few seconds to think and organize your thoughts, use a filler phrase. For example:

- Let me think about that for a second.
- That’s an interesting question.
- What can I say about that?

You can also use filler phrases in the middle of your answer, if you need to pause and think. For example,

- What else can I say?
- Let me see—can I think of an example?
- What other reasons could there be for this?

On the other hand, don’t use filler phrases too much. You can’t use them for every question. Save them for the more complicated questions, when you really need some extra thinking time.

## Be Honest

If you really have no ideas about something, say so.

For example, the examiner asks you:

> Do you think that children do less sport and exercise than in the past?

You could say:

>  I really have no idea. I don’t have children, and none of my friends do either. I’m afraid it’s just not a topic I can say much about.

Be careful: you shouldn’t do this **unless it’s absolutely necessary**. You also need to give a reason why you don’t have anything to say.

You need to make it clear to the examiner that it’s not just your English skills which are stopping you from giving a full answer.

Secondly, if you do this, you can only **really do it once**.

Finally, even if you do this, you should **still try to speculate**. For example:

- I really have no idea. I don’t have children, and none of my friends do either. I’m afraid it’s just not a topic I can say much about. I suppose that children might be less active than in the past, because they spend more time online and playing video games.

##  Interact with the Examiner

During part three of the IELTS speaking exam, you need to listen to what the examiner says, and think about what he/she wants you to do. For example:

- Is the examiner responding to something you said, or asking a new question?
- Is the examiner asking for more details about something you said?
- Is the examiner asking you to give your opinion, or respond to someone else’s opinion?

This also means that you shouldn’t expect to just speak for as long as you want. The examiner can—and will—jump into the conversation to ask extra questions, or to change the direction.

You need to be flexible in part three. In parts one and two, you’re given questions and you can answer without being interrupted. In part three, you need to interact with the examiner. It should be more like a natural conversation, rather than a question-answer format.

## The Examiner's Aims in Part 3

***give you opportunities*** to show the most advanced vocabulary, grammar and coherence skills that you know.

The coherence skills that the examiner is looking at are basically the skills of speaking in a way that is easily understandable, i.e., easy to follow, when you are speaking in depth about several interrelated (complex) issues. At the same time, a rather long Part 3 answer should have a "wholeness" quality i.e., a quality of being unified. This "wholeness" quality is the feeling that everything you say is related to the original question, even when you give a lot of extra details and comments.

More specifically, the examiner is looking at your ability to express in words **the logic** of the interconnection between several ideas (several statements). Your language should be like this: **Statement A + logical connection to Statement B + logical connection to Statement C + . . .  .** Usually, the logical connection words are at the beginning of the next statement, (followed by a comma in writing). The *"statements"* are usually separate sentences but you can make more than one separate statement made within one long sentence.

Some examples of words used to show logical connections are: "*Therefore*, ...";  "*So*, ...";  "*As a result*, ..."; "*On the other hand*, ...";  "*Although X,* ... *Y*" (don't use "but" with "although"); "*In contrast to that*, ..."; *In other words*, ..."; "*As well as that*, ..."; "*For example*, ..."; "*As I mentioned before*, ...";  etc.

For example, you might say **Statement A** (for example, the answer to the question, "*What sorts of music do young people prefer to listen to?*") and then you could follow that with the words, "*But personally,* ..." + **Statement B** (where Statement B probably has words such as "*I prefer to listen to* ...") Using the word, "*But*" is a less formal way to express the idea of, "*In contrast to that*, ..." and a certain amount of less formal language is good in a speaking test. In fact, you don't have to use the word, "*But*" – you could just begin with, "*Personally*, ...", which already includes the idea of "*In contrast to that*, ..." but using the word, "*But*" emphasizes the contrast even more clearly.

## A Good Way to Have Something to Say

If you have trouble thinking about **extra comments to add**, keep in mind that all the topics and sub-topics (e.g., the topic of the immediate question) in Part 3 are in the test because, a) these topics have some importance and, b) there are usually some (social) problems associated with these topics. So, ask yourself, "What is the importance of this?" and "What problems are associated with this?" I

Another good way to prepare for Part 3 is to memorize several **comparative** (比较) statements related to some topics and then find ways to introduce these statements in your 'discussion' (i.e., in your answers). You will get some points for grammar by showing this grammatical feature. For example, if you are preparing for the topic, "Magazines", you can memorize the statement, "*Fewer people buy magazines than newspapers because magazines are more expensive than newspapers.*" Then, in the test, you might be asked the question, "What kinds of magazines are available in China?" You first answer the question by saying what kinds of magazines are available and you try to add a few extra pieces of information about some of the examples you give  –  don't just speak a list. Then, in order to extend the conversation, you can introduce a new idea by using the word, "but" and say, "*, but fewer people buy magazines than newspapers because magazines are more expensive than newspapers.*"

Comparative statements that **compare something in China with something in the West** are particularly suitable because you are speaking to a foreigner in the test!

Make sure you show the examiner the words and phrases that are used to **introduce and link** your ideas, as I show on my website in the Coherence section. You should have practiced using these words and expressions before the test, practiced so much that you can use these words and phrases very quickly.
