## When (at what age) would you say children start to have their own idea

### Words

toddler, imitate, stage

### Ideas

As soon as they’re **born**. If a child is hungry and thinks he needs food, he cries to let you know. If his diaper is wet and he thinks this doesn’t feel good, he cries to let you know. If it’s a **toddler**, it’s really good to teach them a few sign language symbols. That will save you, as a parent, an lot of headaches trying to figure out what your child wants.

## Who do you think has more influence on children's ideas, their parents or their teachers?

### Words

upbringers, stray away from, The opposite could happen as well, no matter

### Ideas

Children are influenced by teachers, parents, AND friends **equally**. You have to first think about **the time spent with the child.**

Parents (guardians) are obviously the upbringers of their children, and have set ways they want to enstill within them. Whether the child takes to their ways or not, there is still some kind of influence. The parent is who is *with the child on weekends, puts them to bed at night, feeds them, is with them during summer months.*

Teachers are with the child from 1–7 hours a day (depending on grade level). They most likely have different views, opinions, and ideas about what a child should know, or do. Depending on the child, they make take the ideas or opinion of the teacher(s) more idealistically therefore **straying away from** how the parents prefer them to be raised. **The opposite could happen as well**, a teacher may have opinions on something, where the child has been raised by parents to completely disagree with that, therefore the parent has more of an impact. Either is ok! That's the great thing about the US!

Students also spend a great amount of time with friends, whether it is only at school, or everyday after school. And these friends have been raised by completely different adults, with different mind sets, as well. If parents are not home often and the child is always with their friend and their family, the influence could then possibly be coming from them.

The child is an independent person, and will always follow the path they were meant to, wether it is friends, family, teachers, or even a complete stranger who they have only met one time.

**No matter your take in a child's life**, influence them to be their best version of themselves, and they will take it from there.

## Can you give an example of a famous person whose ideas have changed people’s lives?

### Words

Confucius /kənˈfjuːʃəs/, believe that, human character, cultivate, moral inspiration, brute force

have faith that, love and respect, be fundamental to, virtue --> virtuous, philosopher, shape culture, recognize one's name

### ideas

Through study and reflection, Confucius came to believe that **human character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, literature, and history**. A person **cultivated** in this way works to help others, guiding them by **moral inspiration** rather than **brute force**.

Confucius also believed that because the love and respect we learn in the family are **fundamental to** all other **virtues**, personal duties to family sometimes **supersede** obligations to the state.

Confucius **had faith that** heaven had a plan for the world, and he taught that a virtuous person could always find joy in learning and music.

Failing to find the ruler he sought, Confucius returned to Lu and became a teacher and philosopher
so **influential**, that he helped **shaped Chinese culture** and we **recognize his name worldwide**, even today.

Students recorded his sayings, which eventually were **edited into a book** we know in English as "The Analects /ˈanlˌek(t)s/."

Today, millions of people worldwide **adhere to** the principles of Confucianism /kənˈfjuːʃənɪzəm/, and though the precise meaning of  his words has been debated for millennia, when asked to summarize his teachings in a single **phrase**, Confucius himself said,

"**Do not inflict upon others that which you yourself would not want.**"

2,500 years later, it's still **sage  /seɪdʒ/ advice**.

### Words

Swallow Rock, in the Yangtze River, shaped like a flying swallow

### Sentences

Swallow Rock is a small scenic area in the northwest part of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. It's one of the three most famous rocks in Nanjing. Swallow Rock is 36 meters high. The rock stands in the Yangtze River, shaped like a flying swallow, so it's called The Swallow Rock.

Swallow Rock is also of minor historical interest for several unrelated events. In the Qing dynasty, when the emperor Qianlong traveled to the south, he passed Swallow Rock and left a poem here and that is now displayed on the rocks. On the top of the rock, there is a pavilion with a stone tablet in it. Swallow Rock is one of the 48 scenic areas in Nanjing.

## A New Building

The term, "public building" does not only refer to government buildings that the general public can enter to conduct business with the government such as applying for a passport. One particular train station, for example, could be called a "public building". Even a privately-owned building such as a cinema that the public pays to use is also a "public building". Even a public toilet in a park could be called a public building! You could even tell the examiner that you would like to visit (use) that building right now! :) In your Part 2 answer, it would be a good idea to say a few words (not too much) to explain how your choice of a building is a "public building".

All buildings are structures that are built. But not all structures that are built are "buildings". For example, the Great Wall of China is a structure but not a building. A building has one or more doors that allow people to go inside it. The Forbidden City in Beijing is not a building - it's a group of buildings.

**Note 1**

In the questions below, you can interpret the words, "What kinds of people?" to mean, "What are some examples of people who . . ?"

***What kinds of people** **need to** **keep awake when they are tired?***

This question is mostly asking you to name **occupations**, such as taxi drivers. But there are very few jobs where you can sleep at work (during work time)! So a more general answer would be that people who are doing work where even falling asleep momentarily would (or could) endanger themselves or other people.

A variation of that question is – ***What kinds of people must (or, have to) keep awake when they are tired?***

This is somewhat different (or can be different) to the previous question. Examples would be people who need to complete a task that night, before they go to sleep because of a deadline such as students who have to finish writing an essay that is due the next day, or journalists who have to finish writing a news story before the printing of tomorrow's newspaper begins (often at around midnight). People who have made a promise to complete a task before a certain deadline are similar.

People such as nurses or mothers of babies must attend to the needs of the people they are taking care of if the occasion demands it, even late at night when they might feel tired such as a crying baby or a patient in hospital who is in great pain or suffering a medical emergency.

**Note 2**

***What kinds of people stay awake even when they are tired?***

This question is similar to, ***What kinds of people can't fall asleep even when they are tired and are trying to fall asleep?***

The most obvious answer to that is, "**insomniacs**" (people suffering from insomnia) – people who can't fall asleep even though they want to. Similarly: people who are under great stress; people who are very worried about something; people experiencing great pain; and people who are in a very noisy or otherwise uncomfortable environment such as extreme cold, extreme heat  or a very uncomfortable bed (after all, we need to feel a certain level of comfort in order to fall asleep).
