Spending a day at high altitude with the **prettiest landscape** is a good way to start my Tibetan adventure!

I still remember the big day that we visited Mt. Everest Basecamp! **I couldn’t keep my eyes of** the mountain range. From the left to the right, nothing but grey rocks and snow covered peaks. This is it! **The highest mountain in the world**. Right there, in front of me. A little tear pops up in the corner of my eye.

### Sentences

**The beauty and power of** mathematical thinking have changed my life. But I know that many people lived a very different story.

Math can be **the best of times or the worst of times**, an **exhilarating** /ɪɡˈzɪləreɪtɪŋ/ journey of discovery or **descent into tedium, frustration, and despair**. 

We practically expect math class to be **repetition and memorization** of disjointed technical facts. when they leave school disliking math, even **committed to** avoiding it for the rest of their lives.

**A good place to start is with the words of** the philosopher and mathematician Descartes, who famously proclaimed, **“I think, therefore I am.”**

It is the thing that doubts, understands, conceives, that affirms and denies, wills and refuses, that imagines also, and perceives. **This is the kind of thinking we need in** every math class **every day**.

**There’s no room to doubt or imagine or refuse**, so there’s no real thinking here.

Thinking happens only when we have time to struggle.

We need to teach kids to be **tenacious** /tɪˈneɪʃəs/ and **courageous** /kəˈreɪdʒəs/, to persevere in the face of difficulty. **The only way to teach perseverance is to give students time to think and grapple /ˈɡræpəl/ with real problems.**

You are not the answer key. “I don’t know. Let’s find out,” math becomes an **adventure**.

Because they know the answers won’t come from me, they need to **convince themselves and argue with each other to determine what’s true**.

By refusing to be the answer key, you **create space for** this kind of mathematical conversation and debate. And this **draws everyone in** because we love to see people disagree.

Einstein called play the highest form of research. Playing with math can feel like running through the woods when you were a kid. And even if you were on a path, it felt like it all belonged to you.

I believe we have the power to help mathematical thinking **flourish** everywhere. We can’t afford to misuse math to create **passive rule-followers**.

Asking questions. Growing mind. Google is a wonderful learning tool to use if we use it right. Once we arrived at that level of asking deeper and more complex questions, that is when you can use Google. Don't forget the power of human mind.

### Sentences

To air a scholarly program during a festive season might mean a risk in audience rating, but the Chinese Poetry Conference, aired a day following the Spring Festival, has proved otherwise.

**The second season** of the China Central Television (CCTV) program, **a competition of poetry recitation, comprehension and appreciation**, became a lunar new year hit right after it was aired on Jan. 29. With a rating that topped one percent, the program grabbed a market share of nearly 16 percent when it ended Tuesday night, **leading all prime time broadcastings**, including hot soap operas, according to media reports.

The champion, Wu Yishu, a 16-year-old high school student, also **shot to stardom for her outstanding performance in the final of the competition**. She has become an **icon** of many high school students and other young people, who say that Wu has **inspired their passion for** the ancient literary form.

More than 100 **competitors participated in the show**. Among them, the youngest one **ages** only seven years old. The competition **has** also **attracted** foreign fans of Chinese poetry.

Wu is from the High School of Fudan University in Shanghai. She adores classic poetry, Chinese traditional costume Hanfu and she always carries along a poem collection of Su Shi, a famous poet in the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It is estimated that the girl can recite more than 2,000 poems.

  "**I wish my daughter will, like Wu, present to the world the self-confidence of our great culture in the future**," a web user with the username of "shudonglidexingxing" wrote on WeChat, a leading social networking service in China.

Another WeChat user "Fangzhanbo" said that the beauty of both Chinese culture and the girl champion is "glamorous and luminous."

Some netizens said that in a society where poetry has been widely assumed to be marginalized to the point of death, Wu's sudden fame, together with the popularity of the program, may bring hope to such cultural treasures.

However, Meng Man, one of the four experts commenting in the TV program, said that the affection to poetry has been buried in people's heart while the popularity of the show helps reignite their passion.

"Just as **the seed buried under the ground can sprout /spraʊt/ because of a drop of water** or a wisp of wind," said Meng.

Well one skill that I have is playing the guitar.

I learned it when I was young. I learned how to play because I had many friends that played the guitar and when they played and sang, I knew I just had to learn. At first it was a little difficult because to be quite frank, I really didn’t see myself as someone who was musically I inclined. I had to tell myself that I could do it and little by little, a note here and a **chord** I there, **I managed to pick it up**. Even now I have a long way to go with playing but I have found it enjoyable not just for myself, for others have said they enjoy it as well. I have had a few guitars and although there are different styles and qualities, to me it seems that as long as they have strings on them and you can **tune** them, they are fine.

I use the guitar to **cheer myself up** when I am feeling a little **down** and also use it to teach songs to others. **I have never made money teaching guitar but I have made a little money playing and singing.** **I don’t know if I would want to pursue this skill as a career but as long as I still enjoy it, I am going to do it.**

This is one of the most attractive and well-maintained parks in my city. It is full of lush **greenery** and there are a variety of trees and flowers.

After jogging, we sat on benches to relax our body. Apart from it, we enjoyed some beverage from the cafeteria which is situated in the right corner of the park. There is a big green lawn also which is [ideal](https://ieltsfever.org/tag/ideal/) for exercise, yoga and fair.

Well, obviously, the best place for reading and writing, in my opinion, is the Beijing Library which is located near the southern Ring Three in Beijing, and it’s also quite near my home.

The library is regular-shaped, but it’s also a famous landmark around there, so I can easily find it when I drive along the road. It’s wrapped in glass on all sides, so the exterior is very gorgeous.

**I always go to the library about twice a month, I’m a regular there.** I’d like to go there in the morning, and borrow some interesting books to read, or write some documents in my laptop. The library has all sorts of books, so I can always get the books I need, or I can ask the librarians to borrow the books I need from other libraries. Their service is really **impeccable**. Besides, the atmosphere there is very **refreshing**. I can do my work quietly and efficiently, and feel like lifting my spirits.

hide-and-seek, 

I played hide-and-seek lots of times when I was a kid.

Normally we played this game with friends or classmates after class or during the weekends in the house.

Firstly, we chose one of us to be the seeker to search around for the rest of us, the hiders.

The game started with the seeker covering his eyes and counting to 10 while everyone else ran off and found a place to hide. When the counting was finished, the seeker began a painstaking search for the hiding kids. And that was my favourite part of the game, because the **suspense** was just so **intense**. The hiders could really **hold their breath, being afraid of getting caught.** But then, there was always someone who got caught and this person would become the next seeker unfortunately.

Hide-and-seek was fun because it was simple. **These days we play computer games to get fun, but sometimes I really missed those simple pleasures of old days.** They were so carefree that they are impressive to me even today.

### Example

One such celebration that **comes to my mind is when I was preparing for my entrance examination after high school**. It was about 7 years ago. I vividly remember this because it was a very crucial phase of my life. I started to prepare for the exam during the last year of my school life and gave plenty much time towards all the subjects.

So the day came and I took my exam. Results were supposed to be declared 2 months from the date of examination. **When the results were finally out, I came to know that I had got admission in the college** of my choice. I felt extremely happy and called my parents to tell about the result. They congratulated me on my achievement. In the evening when I got back home I saw my parents throw me a surprise party along with my friends, who came to my home to congratulate me on my big achievement.

All of them knew that it was a result of a lot of hard work and dedication. Seeing all of them made me a little emotional and I felt overwhelmed. We all danced together for a long time, my father sang a song too and we enjoyed those few hours a lot. After that, we all went to my favourite restaurant to have dinner. We were hungry after all the dancing. We spent around an hour at the restaurant and all of us ate very tasty dishes.

After dinner, my friends went back home and I came back with my parents. Towards the end of that beautiful evening, I found that **hard work always pays off and I was highly moved by the appreciation given to me by my parents and my friends.** I had finally made my parents proud and this gave me a sense of satisfaction. I was looking forward to a new phase of my life and I knew I would give it my best shot.

The selection process was **filled with complexity**. It is really difficult to find out the right gift for someone. Before the gift selection, one needs to consider some aspects about the **recipient /rɪˈsɪpiənt/** like as the preference of the recipient, the colour of the present, celebration theme, and many more issues. Though this was simply a birthday, I needed to consider some of the aforesaid matters. He was a small boy of two years of age. So, I need to **focus on his entertainment issues**.

## Describe someone who speaks a foreign language well

Well, speaking a foreign language has now become common almost everywhere. In my country, everyone knows English as a foreign language and can speak at some level. However, here I'd like to talk about my friend who speaks other than English foreign language fluently, and his name is Steven. He is now 43 but easily could pass for 30.

Among many languages he speaks, French is one of his **fluent spoken languages**. He speaks like a native speaker, whenever he speaks with native speakers even they also can't figure it out he is **non-native**. His pronunciation is just like a French news reader. I've been really **blown away with** his foreign language skill.

Concerning about where did he learn, you won't believe, **without interacting with native speakers**, he **learned through** French movies. He has **a predilection /ˌpriːdɪˈlekʃən / of** French cinema and watches at least 2 movies in a day. On top of this, he never misses watching French TV shows. Although he doesn't know grammar well, he never makes a mistake while speaking.

Overall, one thing I learned from his skill is that no matter where are we, we can learn any language if we have interest in them. I just loved the way he learns a foreign language.

Well, children are **innocent** and they often make others laugh with their **farcical actions**. So one such event I'd like to talk about it. It was a few days ago when I was talking with next door kids.

There are quite a few kids leaving around my house, so I have a chit chat with them regularly. That day I decide to talk to them about **what they would like to become** when they grow up. I choose this topic just know about their knowledge. But it turned out all those kids knew about professional at an earlier age.

One child among them told me that I want to become a pilot, a doctor, an engineer, a teacher, an astronaut, and a father. I was confused and asked him back, **how a single person can possess different skills at the same**. **What he replied to me was really hilarious**, he told me that every other day I'll change my **occupation** because my Dad is a political leader, and he can allow me to **work in any field.**

To sum up, this was a really laughable and strange answer to me. **I couldn't stop laughing for an hour thinking about his answer.** They really blew me away with their knowledge. I think kids nowadays gain knowledge by watching rhymes and videos.
