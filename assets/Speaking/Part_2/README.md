# How to Do Part Two of the IELTS Speaking Test

https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/ielts-speaking-exam-part-two

## Basic Information about the IELTS Speaking Exam

The examiner will give you a card with a topic. You have **one minute to prepare** a short speech on the topic. After one minute, the examiner will ask you to speak. You need to talk for **between one and two minutes**.

After you finish, the examiner will ask you **one or two simple questions** about what you said.

> Describe an important choice you made.
>
> You should say:
>
> - What choices you had
> - What you decided
> - How easy it was to make your decision
>
> …and explain how you feel about this choice now.

## How to Use Your Preparation Time

The first thing you should do: **ask the examiner if there are any words you don’t understand!**

Asking the examiner will use some of your time, and that’s not ideal. But, starting to talk if you haven’t understood the question will be much worse. Don’t do it!

Secondly, look at the question. It has four parts: the three bullet points, and the part at the end—“…explain why this thing is important to you.”

 Try to think of one or two things you can say for each part of the question. Make short notes to help you remember your points.

How can you make effective notes? Let’s look:

For example, let’s say you want to talk about choosing what to study at university. You write:

- Computer science/engineering
- IT—interesting career opportunities
- Difficult—pros and cons on both sides
- Satisfied—IT work is interesting/creative

## How to Organize Your Answer

- start with an opening phrase

  Say something like:

  - I’m going to tell you about…
  - I’d like to talk about…
  - I’ve decided to talk about…

- Make 1-2 sentences about each bullet point

- Stay focused; don't go off-topic

- Make 3-4 sentences about the last part of the question

- Finish with a concluding phrase, such as:

  - That’s why I feel that…
  - Finally, when I look back at my decision now…
  - I’m glad I made the decision I did.

  Obviously, the finishing phrases aren’t like the opening phrases, which you can use for any topic. The finishing phrases will depend on the question you get. Just remember: you need to finish strongly; don’t just…

## Adding Details to Your Answer

For each point, try to give at least one fact and at least one opinion. For example, don’t say:

>  I had to choose between [studying computer science and studying engineering](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talk-about-your-studies).

Say:

> I had to choose between studying computer science and studying engineering. I was interested in both, although I always felt that studying computer science was a better choice.

Don’t say:

> I decided to study computer science.

Say:

> I decided to study computer science, because I felt that it would give me more interesting career opportunities.

## How Long Should You Speak?

ou can speak for up to two minutes. After two minutes, the examiner will stop you, even if you’re in the middle of your sentence.

If the examiner stops you, that’s not necessarily a problem. It doesn’t affect your score if you go too long. However, if you’ve **haven’t covered all the parts of the question, that could be a problem.**

That’s why a good goal is to **speak for 90 seconds**. This should give you enough time to say everything you want to say.

Practice, and time yourself.

First, speak and look at your timer, on your phone or wherever. Answer the same question several times. Your goal is to **cover all parts of the question in 90 seconds**.

Later, when you’re more comfortable with this, **practice your answers, but don’t look at the timer.** At the end, guess how long you spoke for, and then look at the timer to check.

Practising will help you to understand how much you can say in 90 seconds.

## Dealing with Common Problems

> I don't have anything to say about this topic!

- Practice with difficult / boring question and topics.
- Lie/make up an answer
- Use someone else's ideas and make them about yourself

in other parts of the IELTS exam, it can be OK to say “I don’t know,” or “I don’t have anything to say about that.” But in part two, you **must answer the question**. You can’t change the topic or adapt it.

> I'm so nervous

- Accept that feeling slightly nervous is natural
- Practice making presentations or speeches in English

## Summary

1. Prepare carefully, making sure you have something to say for each part of the question.
2. Structure your speech, with a clear beginning and ending.
3. Add details to your answer where possible, especially for the last part of the question.
4. Speak for around 90 seconds.
5. Practice in advance, including boring questions, difficult questions, and speaking in situations where you feel nervous.

If you have to ask a question about the meaning of a word, it is much better to ask it this way, "Does ____ mean something like ____?" than to simply ask, "What does ____ mean?" Examiners are allowed to give you help but they are not supposed to give a 'dictionary definition'. Instead, they will give you an example or say "It's similar to _____". As well as that, if your guess is close to correct, the examiner will think your vocabulary is better than if you just ask, "What does ____ mean?"

## How to begin talking?

Many candidates are not sure how to begin talking in Part 2. As mentioned previously, it is not a good idea to begin with words such as, "**I'd like to tell you about  ..."** because that beginning doesn't seem suitable for a 'conversation situation', which is what the Speaking test represents. In other words, it is not necessary to give a formal-sounding introduction to your Part 2 'story'. 

Not only that, **so many** candidates begin by saying, "**I'd like to tell you about  ..."** that it's boring for examiners to hear. 

### When

For example, many Part 2 topics ask you to talk about an experience you have had. That is, you have to give a past tense answer. For these, **the logical beginning is to mention the time of this experience in your first sentence**. For example, if the topic is, "**Describe some useful advice that you have received**" a suitable way to 'jump into the story' is to begin by saying, "**About three years ago** I was discussing my future career with my parents and my father gave me some really useful advice. He said ..."

A very good way to start almost any Past tense topic is to **say when it happened** **in the very first words of the first sentence.** You can begin your very first sentence like this - "***About three years ago,*** .... + past tense", "***When I was ten years old,*** .... + past tense", "**A few years ago,** ..... + past tense" , "***When I was in primary school,*** ... + past tense", etc.

### Summarization

However, although that is a good beginning, it could be even better. **A key idea** for beginning your Part 2 story, whatever the topic, is to **summarize the point of the last line on the task card in your first sentence**. 

Here's an example: "**About three years ago I was discussing my future career with my parents and my father gave me some advice, which was really useful because it saved me from making a big mistake in my choice of career. He said ..."**

In general, the models are these:

**".... noun, relative pronoun + verb + key adjective + because ...."**

or,

**".... noun, relative pronoun + verb + because"**

#### Examples

"Last year I saw a type of dog called a Shar-pie, **which** was very interesting to me **because** I had never before seen a dog with so much loose skin." (Comma before "which".)

"It's a restaurant **that / which** I especially like **because** ... " (No comma before "which" or that")

"When I was in junior high school I had a maths teacher, Mr. Wang, **who** really influenced me a lot **because** he completely changed my attitude towards mathematics." Notice how much information is packed into that one sentence.

### Using the Word, 'Well' to Start Talking

So, it is very natural to use "Well" before any of the examples I have written in the previous five pages of notes about Part 2 such as, "***Well,*** ***about three years ago,*** ...."; or, "***Well,*** **when I was in junior high school, ....** ". In fact, those examples would be better if they began with, "Well, ..."

### The Mistake of Using "the"

So what is the best way to begin? It's this –

***Well, one book I (especially) enjoyed reading was called, "Gulliver's Travels" because...***

## How to finish talking?

So, if you finish your story and you know you have answered the four points on the card adequately and you also know that you have spoken for a decent length of time (i.e., more than 1 minute 20 seconds) ***but*** if the examiner doesn't seem to realize you have finished, you should immediately tell the examiner that you have finished. Just say something short and quick such as, "***I've finished now***", "***That's it***", "***That's all***", "***That's the end***", "***That's all I have to say***" or something similar to those. Then the examiner will say, "**Thank you**" and Part 2 will come to an end. (Possibly you will be asked one or two quick 'follow-up' questions before Part 2 is completely finished.) As much as you can, you must avoid long periods of silence in the Speaking test! (Except for the 1-minute of thinking time, of course.)

One common way to finish a story is to say something like, "***Well, that's my story about XYZ*** " where, 'XYZ' is the topic of the story, as shown in the first line of the task card, beginning with the word, "Describe". For example, "***Well, that's my story about an interesting animal I saw at the zoo.***" or, "***So, that's the interesting animal I saw last year***" or, "***Well, that's my story about old Mr. Wang***" (after describing an old person who you admire). Of course, you don't have to say the word, "Well" or "So" but it does sound more natural to begin this sentence that way. And you don't have to include the word "story" – you could say something such as, "***So, that's what happened on my trip to Qingdao***" (after telling a story about a place with lots of water that you visited). Notice that you need to say the word, "that" and you basically summarize or repeat the topic, as outlined in the first line of the card.

Another way to finish, which is similar to repeating the topic, is to repeat your main feeling or the main point of your story. For example, let's say you told a story about a teacher who greatly influenced you in your education. To end, you could say, "***Yes, he really did influence me a lot.***" and say it in a reflective sort of way, possibly nodding your head as you say it. Or, after telling a story about a success you had, "***Yeah, I was quite proud of myself for reaching that goal. It wasn't easy at all!***" Or, after telling a story about some good advice you received, "***Yes, I'm so glad he gave me that advice. It really did help me.***" The idea here is to repeat something you have already said, (preferably using slightly different words). If it is the first time that you express this idea in your story, it might not sound like the end. The most natural way to say these sentences is to begin with the word, "Yes" or "Yeah" or some similar word, such as , "Really", as in , "***Really, I'm so glad he gave me that advice.***" 

This repetition of your main point or feeling can be made even stronger, i.e., can be emphasized, by adding one more sentence – an, "If not" sentence. For example, "**Yes, he really did influence me a lot.** ***If I had never met Mr. Li, I doubt that I would be an engineer today.***" Or, "**Yeah, I was quite proud of myself for reaching that goal. It wasn't easy at all!** ***I think if I had given up, I would never have forgiven myself.***" Or, "**Yes, I'm so glad he gave me that advice. It really did help me.** ***If he hadn't given me that advice, I'm sure I would have made a big mistake in my choice of career.***"

## Follow-up Questions

a) Not every candidate as asked a follow-up question. b) Most follow-up questions are 'Yes/No' questions. c) Give a somewhat short answer but not just a simple, "Yes" or "No".
