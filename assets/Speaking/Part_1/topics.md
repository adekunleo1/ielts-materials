  Nanjing North Railway Station (Chinese: 南京北站) is a railway station in Nanjing's Pukou District which was built in 1914. Located near the northern shore of the Yangtze River, it was a busy station because people had to get off the train and cross Yangtze River by ferry, and to resume the journey from the Nanjing West Railway Station on the southern bank of the river.

  After Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was built, the use of the station declined. Presently, it has no passenger service.

  It has also been mentioned by quite some literary works, and has become a filming location for films and TV plays in recent years. It is the only railway station in China that has kept the features of the Republic of China (1912-1949), as well as the first “hundred-year-old railway station” in China that keeps complete historical features.
