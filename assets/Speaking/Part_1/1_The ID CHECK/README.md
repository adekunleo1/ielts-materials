# The ID CHECK

Source: http://ielts-yasi.englishlab.net/The_Introduction_Phase.htm

**Note that EVERY candidate is asked these questions, exactly (or almost exactly) as they are written here.**

## The Standard Introduction Questions

1. **“Good morning (good afternoon). My name’s X. Can you tell me your full name, please?”**  (= Please tell me your name.)

   ```
   Good morning/afternoon, XX. My name is Zhang Xin.
   You can just call me Xin.
   ```

2. **“What can I call you?”** (= What shall I call you? = What should I call you? = What would you like me to call you?)

3. **“Can you tell me where you’re from?”** (= Where are you from?)

   ```
   Well, I grew up in Jurong, Jiangsu Province but I've been studying in Nanjing for the past six years.
   ```

4. **“Can I see your identification, please?”** (= Could I see your identification, please? = May I see your identification, please?)

   ```
   Sure, here you are.
   ```

The four questions are standard questions that are used in every test. Therefore, since we know exactly what the questions will be, it is a good idea to look at them now in order to avoid making unnecessary mistakes.

1. Then the examiner says something like: **“Good morning. My name’s John. Could you tell me your full name, please?”**

   - A suitable reply is: “**Good morning, John. My name is Wang Jianfeng.**” If you do not include his name, it doesn’t matter too much but remember that the examiner is a human being and hearing you say his name would be a pleasant surprise for him! He will think of you, “What a nice person!”

   - Don’t call the examiner, “Sir”, “Miss” or “Madame”. If you didn’t hear his or her name, just say, “Good morning.”

   - Don’t change the order of your name and say your name is, “Jianfeng Wang”. (Even if you do the test overseas, respect your Chinese naming system.) However, if you wrote your name that way on the application form, then it probably is the best way to answer the question.

     Your name will (usually) be written as, "Wang Jianfeng" on the application form, which is what the examiner is looking at as you say your name.

2. Then the examiner will say: **“What can I call you?”** (Or, “What shall I call you?”)

   - You don’t need to use an English name!
   - Most examiners in China are (or should be) used to candidates saying, “Just call me Xiao Wang” but, to be on the safe side, it might be better if you said, **“Just call me Wang.”** or, **“Just call me Jianfeng.”** without using the word “xiao”.
   - If you have a two-word name such as Liu Xiang and if this is what you would like to be called, don't say the name in exactly the same way as you said it in your answer to the first question. For example, for the first answer, you should say something like, “My name is Liu Xiang”, with the emphatic stress on your name. But for the second question, you should say something like, **“Just call me Liu Xiang”, with the stress on the word “just”,** not on your name this time because you are not saying something new.
   - If you use the word, **‘just’, don’t pronounce the ‘t’** – the ‘t’ is 95% silent
   - ‘Can’ is pronounced as ‘kæn’, a) when we ask a question – “Can you help me?”, “Can you swim?” and, b) when we want to emphasize, for example, when we say, “Yes, I can.” However, it is pronounced as ‘kən’ or even, “k’n” when we speak sentences such as: “I can speak English”, “I can drive a car” and “She can play the piano.”

3. The third question that the examiner will ask you is: **“Could you tell me where you’re from?”**  (Or, “Can you tell me where you’re from?”)

   - For this question, it is suitable, (and perhaps a good idea) to add a **small** amount of extra information if you want but try to say it quickly and in a short sentence. For example you could say: “**I’m from Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province**.” Or, “**I’m from Shenyang, Liaoning Province. That’s in north-east China**.” (In that sentence, don't put strong sentence stress on the word ‘China’ because if you are doing the test in China, the examiner knows you are from China so there is no need to emphasize that word.)
   - Make sure you don’t make a grammatical error such as: “**I’m from Shenyang, Liaoning, north-east** **of** **China**.” ‘North-east of China’ means **out of China** (for example, Korea). The correct phrase here is, ‘in the north-east of China’ or, ‘in north-east China’.
   - Some candidates worry about which place they should say when they answer where they come from. You should choose the place where you grew up. If the address on your application form is different to the place where you grew up, it is entirely appropriate, and a good idea, to quickly explain your situation, for example: “**Well, I grew up in Changchun, Jilin Province but I've been studying in Beijing for the past four years.**” Examiners know that many people move to different places to study or work.

4. The final introduction question is: **“Could I see your identification, please?”** You should have your 身份证 in your hand or on the table in front of you, ready to give to the examiner.

   - More than 80% of candidates say, “Here you are.” (or, “Sure. Here you are.”) as they hand over their ID card. There is nothing really wrong with this small sentence – it is suitable and it sounds polite. However, many candidates in China have learned this sentence from a book but have never actually heard a native speaker say it, even in a recording. The fact is that this small sentence is most frequently used in **spoken** English and is spoken **quite fast and smoothly, with the major stress on the word, ‘Here’.** If you can say it so that it sounds ‘natural’, that is, so that the examiner does not immediately think, “That’s from an IELTS book!”, then it is OK. But my advice is try to find something else to say because it sounds a little too rehearsed and since almost everybody says it, it is so predictable and boring for examiners!
