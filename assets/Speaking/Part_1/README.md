## About the IELTS Speaking Exam Part One

After you introduce yourself, the examiner will ask you some simple questions about **one or two topics**.

Some common topics are: where you live, [your job](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talking-about-job), [your family](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talking-about-family), your free time, [food](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talk-food-video-lesson), sports, and others like this.

Section one of the IELTS speaking test lasts **four-five minutes**. The examiner reads questions from a script, so it’s not a discussion—just **question and answer**.

## The First Questions in IELTS Speaking Exam Part One

At the beginning of the exam, the examiner will ask you some basic questions:

- What’s your name?
- Where are you from?
- Can I see some identification, please?

Answer the examiner in **full sentences**. Don’t say, “Berlin,” say,

- I’m from Berlin.

Don’t say, “Andrew,” say,

- My name is Andrew Gray.

Speak in a clear, confident voice. Make eye contact with the examiner. Making a strong start will help you to feel more in control.

## Speaking [Fluently](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/speak-english-fluently) and Clearly

Let’s start with a simple question:

- [Describe your hometown](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talking-about-hometown).

Answer number one:

> I come from Moscow. It’s a big city.

It’s too short, and there aren’t any details.

Answer number two:

> I’m from Moscow. As you may know, Moscow is the capital of Russia. I’m really proud of my city and I miss it when I’m not there. In my neighbourhood, there are many cafes and parks where I like to hang out with friends in the evening.

However, this answer isn’t really answering the question. The answer talks about how you feel about your hometown, and what you like doing there.

> I come from Moscow. It’s a very large city, and also the capital, so it’s very busy and crowded. It’s the kind of place where people always seem to be in a hurry. The centre has a lot of historical buildings and monuments, while out of the centre there are mostly just residential areas.

## Using Vocabulary Effectively in Your Answers

Let’s look at another question:

- [Describe your home](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/talking-about-home).

> I live in an apartment in a big building. My apartment has four rooms. There is a bedroom, a living room, and a kitchen. The fourth room is a… Um… I forgot the word in English.

> I live in a mid-sized apartment in a tower block. It has four rooms in total, with a tiny bedroom, an open-plan living room with a dining area, and a kitchen. Then there’s a… What’s the word? Like an office, where I do some work or studying sometimes.

The use of vocabulary is much better in the second answer.

If you don’t know a word, don’t panic, and don’t give up. Try to find other words or phrases which have a similar meaning.

When preparing for your IELTS exam, think about the topics which can appear in part one of the IELTS speaking test. Learn some **more advanced or interesting vocabulary you could use for each topic**.

For example, learn and practice ten words to describe your home, ten words to describe your hometown, ten words to talk about your hobbies, and so on.

##  Improving Your Grammar Score in Part One of the IELTS Speaking Exam

Let’s look at our third question:

- [What do you like doing in your free time?](https://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/free-time-and-hobbies)

> I have a lot of different hobbies. What I do depends on my mood. For example, if I’m feeling energetic, I like to play basketball or go jogging. If I want to relax, I read a book or cook something. I find cooking very relaxing.

> I have lot of hobbies. I’m doing different things depending on what’s my mood. For example, if I am very energy, I will play basketball or go to jogging. If I want to relaxation, I read some books or cook something. Cooking is relaxing to me.

It might surprise you that answer number two is better than number three, even though there are many, many grammar mistakes in the second answer.

Secondly, the second candidate’s answer is clear. There are lots of grammar mistakes, but the mistakes don’t make it difficult to understand.

This is another important point: in the IELTS exam, **mistakes which don’t affect your meaning are not a big problem.**

If you need a score in the 6.0-7.0 range, you don’t need to have perfect grammar, just like you don’t need to have perfect vocabulary. You do need to use what you know to communicate clearly. That’s much more important.

So, if you know that your grammar is not perfect, it’s better to try to **speak fluently and express yourself clearly**. You can still get a good score in the IELTS speaking test.

## Summary

Let’s review what we’ve talked about today. To get a higher score in part one of the IELTS speaking test, you need to:

- Give longer, more detailed answers without going off-topic.
- Use a range of vocabulary to make your answers more descriptive.
- Find a way to express yourself even if you don’t know a word.
- Try to use some longer, more grammatically complex sentences even if you make some mistakes.
