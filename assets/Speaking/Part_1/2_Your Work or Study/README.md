# Your Work or Study

After you are sure that you can answer these first four questions of the test with no major errors, you should then prepare to answer questions for the topic of, 'Your Work or Your Studies.' This topic is ***almost always*** one of the Part 1 topics in the examiner's question book and there is ***a 50% chance*** that you will get this topic.

If the examiner chooses to ask you questions on this topic, he or she will probably ask you **3 to 5 different questions**.  Of course, most of these questions change every 4 months even though the topic itself, **'Your Work or Your Studies' is included as a possible topic for almost every test**. Although most of the questions change, there are a few questions that do not change or only change a little. In the notes below, I will discuss these highly probable questions and how you should answer them. I will also mention several common errors that you should avoid.

After the 4 introduction questions, the examiner usually says something very similar to the following words: "**Now I'd like to ask you a few more questions about yourself**." Then the examiner will choose your **first Part 1 topic**. If the examiner chooses the topic of  'Your Work or Your Studies', he or she will usually say something very similar to these words: "**Let's first talk about what you do. Do you work or are you a student?**"

If you are (or were) a university student, it is extremely important that you know how to **correctly say what you are studying** (or were studying). Similarly, if you work, it is extremely important to know how to correctly state what your job is.

## Your Studies

### “Do you work or are you a student?”

```
I’m a student at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
Now, I'm a Ph.D candidate. It's my first year. I've got three more years to go.
```

- It is quite a serious mistake to begin your answer to this question with the word ‘Yes’ or the word ‘No’. This is not a ‘Yes/No’ question.

- It is also unsuitable to say what you are **not**; instead, say what you **are**. For example, don’t say, “I’m not working. I’m a student.”
- For example, “I’m a student at Renmin University in Beijing,” or  “I’m a student, at university.” or “I’m a student, a university student.” (**Put the stress on the word “university”, not on “student”.**) Another suitable answer is: “I’m a student, a second-year university student.”

- Make sure that you pronounce ‘graduate’ (noun) in the phrase ‘a graduate student’ as  . (And stress the first word, not the second.)

  When it is a verb it is pronounced as  .
  In both British and American English we say, “graduated from university”.

- If you have already completed some post-graduate qualification, it sounds a little more appropriate to say “**I completed (or finished) my Master's degree last year**,”

### “What subject are you studying?” 

```
I'm studying Atmospheric Physics, especially clouds and lightning. It's about how clouds are formed, what's happening in the clouds and the changes in the future.
```

This question is for **current** university students and it means the same as “What's your major?”

Be careful of the exact wording of this question and try to answer using the same verb tense. The most common variation of this question is: “**What subject do you study?**”  which means the same as, “What subject are you studying?” The verb tenses are slightly different but since they are both different kinds of present tense, it's suitable to use either **‘I'm studying**’ or **‘I study’** in your answer, no matter which form of question is used.

### “Why did you choose to study that?”

```
I chose it because I loved nature, which is gorgeous and fascinating.
You know, when I was a child, I stared at the sky and clouds from time to time.
So, I wanted to learn more about it.
```

- This is a **past tense question** so the best answer is spoken in the past tense.
- Most of the examples above are just one-sentence answers, showing you the grammar. However, you should try to answer longer than that – try to give more reasons and some extra detail. This question is not an example of a short Part 1 question – it could be a ‘middle-sized’ answer or a longer answer if you have something to say.

### “Do you like it?”

```
Yes, absolutely. Because I've always been interested in clouds and lightning and I'm hoping to do research about these. Everything's so interesting that it doesn't feel like work! yeah, I'm really enjoying it.
(Writing codes is one of my hobbies and I get to explore the mystery of cloud, lightning and satellite using my own codes.)
```

- This is a ‘Yes/No’ question
- This is also a question that **asks for your feelings**. As a general rule in the Speaking test, whenever you state your feelings, preference or opinion, **immediately follow that with why you feel or think this way.** Don't force the examiner to waste time by asking you, “Why?” If you don't first answer why, the examiner usually must ask you to say why.
