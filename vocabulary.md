## IELTS speaking part 1 - sample questions and answers

#### Examiner: Do you come from a large family?

Answer: My immediate family is not very big. I have a large extended family that includes many uncles, aunts, and cousins. We are a close-knit family, and we like to keep in touch with one another, so birthdays, and other celebrations, are noisy crowded affairs.

#### Examiner: When was the last time you had a family function?

Answer: Our extended family got together last year to celebrate my grandfather’s eightieth birthday. He is very dear to my heart. He has kept up healthy relationships with the whole family, so it was a happy occasion that we all enjoyed.

#### Examiner: Would you take a friend on a family holiday?

Answer: I have. My family and my best friend got to know each other quite well, as she visited me quite frequently at my home. My family believes that we should nurture our friendships, so they encouraged me to bring my friend along when we took a seaside holiday last year.

## IELTS speaking part 2 - sample question and answer

#### Examiner: Tell me about your best friend.

To answer this question in full,

discuss who the person is,
the circumstances of your meeting,
and what it is that you like about them.

Answer: My best friend and I got to know each other when we were still very young. We lived in neighbouring houses. We had a lot in common, so we soon hit it off.

As we have grown older, we have moved apart. Because of this, we have to some degree lost touch, but anyone who has had a lifelong friend would understand that she will always be dear to my heart.

When we do find ourselves in the same city, we arrange a dinner date, so that we can enjoy each other’s company. We share the same ideas, and we share a common background.

We enjoy reminiscing about our past exploits. When we struck up a friendship, as children, we were inseparable. In those early days, we built up a relationship of trust that time and distance cannot break.

## IELTS speaking part 3 - sample questions and answers

#### Examiner: Do you think that after-hour friendships between working colleagues are appropriate?

Answer: I think that it is important to have a good working relationship. Colleagues should extend the hand of friendship to newcomers in the workplace. I don’t believe, however, that professional relationships should extend into the domestic domain as this may affect office politics.

#### Examiner: Do you think that social media is changing the way that we relate to our friends and family?

Answer: In some ways yes. Social media allows us to build up relationships with distant cousins, even with those that live on foreign soil. It also helps us to make connections with long lost friends, who we may never have spoken to or seen again. On the other hand, we often spend far too much time on our digital devices instead of socializing face to face.

#### Examiner: Do you think that people who enter into a long-term relationship, should continue with their friendships from their single days?

Answer: I think that it is important to nurture our friendships whether or not we are in a long-term relationship. Not all relationships stand the test of time, and if you have relationship problems you may one day need a shoulder to cry on. In my view, too many people abandon their friends when they become involved in relationships.

## Examples of IELTS speaking part 1 questions

#### Examiner: What food do you like to eat?

Answer: I am not a fussy eater. As long as you don’t feed me rabbit food I’m easy to please. My flatmate and I share the cooking chores. Once a week we make a slap-up meal of steak and chips covered in a rich sauce and to satisfy the sweet tooth we finish off with a decadent chocolate pudding.

#### Examiner: So, do you enjoy cooking?

Answer: I prefer eating to cooking. I make good use of ready meals and I am not averse to junk food or the occasional pub lunch. I realize though that it is necessary to include nutritious food in my diet, which is why I cook several times a week.

#### Examiner: What’s your favourite meal of the day?

Answer: I’m a breakfast fan. I wake up starving hungry after a good night’s sleep. I like nothing better than a good English breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttery toast, along with a piping hot cup of coffee.

## IELTS speaking part 2 question

#### Examiner: Tell me about your favourite restaurant

In this question, you should discuss

the restaurant that you like best,
why you like it,
and the occasions when you go there.
Answer: I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals.

The menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food.

This is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. After settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.

## IELTS speaking part 3 questions

#### Examiner: Do you believe that the 21st Century diet is a healthy one?

Answer: Far too many people are overweight. I believe that people should cut down on sugars and refined carbohydrates and replace them with leafy vegetables and seasonal fruits. A balanced diet would help them to regulate their weight.

#### Examiner: Starvation is a problem in many parts of the world. What do you think should be done about it?

Answer: From what I’ve read current global food production can cover the daily consumption needs of the world. We need to find a way to economically transport it to where it is most needed or find alternate food sources. Nobody should starve when there is no shortage of food.

#### Examiner: In homes where both parents work do you think cooking has become just another job at the end of the day?

Answer: I know that food preparation can be time-consuming, but if everyone helps with ideas and recipes and everyone takes a turn and lends a hand, cooking can be fun for the family. Home cooked meals are also often healthier and packed with vitamins.

## Examples of questions about holiday travel

#### Examiner: Where do you like to travel during the holidays?

Answer: I like to travel abroad but it can be expensive, so I usually plan affordable travel. Travelling to holiday destinations when it is out of season saves a lot of money. Out of season travel is also the best way to avoid places that are swarming with tourists.

#### Examiner: What are your favourite holiday pastimes?

Answer: I like to get away from it all. I look for exotic destinations with scenic views that are off the beaten track. I tend to avoid guided tours and packaged deals as I prefer to go sightseeing on my own.

#### Examiner: How do you plan and prepare for your holiday?

Answer: I always do my research. I thumb through holiday brochures and check travel sites like Airbnb on the Internet. I’m drawn to spectacular beaches and lush forests. I usually make advance reservations for self-catering accommodation.

## Part 2 style questions

#### Examiner: Describe one of your best travel experiences.

This type of question supports a when, where and who reply.

Answer: Last year a friend and I took a long-haul flight to Peru. We were travelling light so we were able to really get around. We stayed in quaint villages and hiked through lush rainforests. We were determined to do as the locals do, so we stayed with local people for part of the trip.

We visited colourful craft markets and brought back souvenirs, to remind us of our trip. One of my most memorable experiences was to the Sacred Valley of the Incas. It is a little bit off the beaten track but it is surrounded by great scenic beauty and magnificent landscapes.

## Part 3 style questions

#### Examiner: What type of holiday destination do you think attracts most tourists?

Answer: I know that many people are drawn to wildlife safaris. This is certainly one of the big attractions in Africa. In Europe and Asia, the stunning architecture, museums and arts and culture attract thousands of tourists every year.

#### Examiner: Do you think that the tourism industry will continue to grow in the next two decades?

Answer: I do. Many European and Asian countries have aging populations who will have time on their hands in the future. Many of them are likely to seek holiday destinations around the world. Today there are many affordable destinations that offer good value for money.

#### Examiner: What do you think that your country could do to attract more tourists?

Answer: My country has stringent visa regulations. If these were relaxed, I think that more visitors would choose to visit. We have an efficient public transport, plenty of accommodation and natural and historical places of interest.

## Example of speaking part 1 questions

#### What type of technology do you use in your home?

Answer: We have a number of labour-saving devices including state of the art technology in our kitchen. These appliances include an induction stove, a dishwasher, and an Internet-enabled refrigerator. All are connected through the Internet of Things so we can remotely control them.

#### Are you comfortable using modern technology?

Answer: You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to use technology today. It’s all about booting up, logging in and then clicking on the icon that will take you to your favourite application. On the single occasion that my computer crashed, I called someone in to re-install the programs otherwise I’m comfortable.

#### How do you keep your computer and data secure?

Answer: I always shut down the computer at night. I backup my files to a hard drive and I always keep hard copies of important documents. I am very careful with my privacy settings, especially in wireless hotspots.

## Speaking part 2 questions

#### Describe an item of modern technology that is most important to you?

In this type of question, you should describe the type of technology that you use, how long you have been using it, how frequently you use it and how it is a necessary part of your life.

Answer: My laptop is the most important digital appliance in my home. I have had a laptop for years, but I have recently upgraded my computer.

I am computer literate. I study from home and I need Internet access to do my research. Advances in technology have also made it possible for me to work from home. I surf the web in search of freelance opportunities.

In my leisure time, I download books and music from the Internet. I pay for these via Electronic Funds Transfer. I do not condone online piracy, as I value the arts and believe that the authors and songwriters should be rewarded for their work.

I use social media networks to keep up with my friends and family across the globe and I also shop online from time to time.

## Part 3 questions

#### Do you think that there are any disadvantages to modern technology?

Answer: I think that there are several disadvantages. Security can be a problem with people hacking into the Internet. Also, modern technology tends to become rapidly obsolete so we become more and more a throw-away society. People are also losing physical contact with one another as they become glued to their screens.

In what ways do you think people will benefit from technologies in the future?

Answer: Emerging technology has the capacity to change our lives in so many ways. Robots and artificial intelligence are both reducing the amount of tedious work required in a wide range of industries and professions. We can now also get expert advice from across the globe using an internet connection.

In your opinion what are the basic computer skills that every person should have today?

Answer: All the information we require is available on the Internet, so everyone should be able to boot up a computer, log in and know how to use a search engine. Everyone should have access to the Internet so that they can surf the web.

## IELTS speaking part 1 style questions

#### Examiner: Has there been an increase in pollution where you live?

Georgio: Yes, there has been a dramatic increase in recent years as many of the most productive factories are built on the outskirts of large towns and some are even in quite central areas so very near where people live. Air pollution, as a result of factory emissions and toxic fumes has become a real problem.

#### Examiner: How has this pollution had an impact on daily life, do you think?

Helena: I think there are two key areas which have been most affected – firstly, our health, as air pollution is terrible in the city centre because too many workers commute and rely heavily on their cars rather than travelling by public transport and there are many traffic jams. Secondly, on the quality of crops and in rural areas, where the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in farming has contributed to a dangerous amount of pollutants in foods.

#### Examiner: Are residents in your town good at recycling? 

Sara: Sadly, in my opinion, not nearly good enough. I know in many European countries, the mantra of reuse and recycle plastics and cardboards has become automatic but here there is still a culture of throwing everything away and most domestic as well as industrial waste is incinerated. Obviously, this policy just contributes to worsening air pollution and to plastic being thrown into the sea.

## IELTS speaking part 2 style question

#### Describe a time when you have caused pollution,

You should say:

When this was
What it was
Where it was
And the impact which you think this might have caused.

Zoe: I would like to describe a moment when I was on holiday a few years ago in a really beautiful part of India on holiday with a group of friends. We had been travelling around India for a month and I think I had adjusted to seeing a huge amount of waste on the streets. Not surprisingly, there were very limited facilities for recycling – this is not really part of the culture and it would require a huge investment to put in place the equipment and education programme needed.

We were travelling on a train and had been sleeping as it was a very long journey and early the next morning when we pulled into the station, everyone leaned out of the window and purchased bottles of water, cups of tea and hot food from excited street sellers on the platforms.

I was happy to join in with the locals and without even thinking drank my water then threw the bottle back out of the window which is something I would never have done back home. It wasn’t until later that I understood the consequences of this action.

After winding through the countryside for hours, the train finally reached the coast. I was stunned – rather than a beautiful, clear blue stretch of ocean, all I could see was plastic waste – bottles, bags, food packaging as well as larger items of industrial items were just floating, interspersed with a few seabirds who looked utterly confused and were not really able to swim.

I could clearly see the impact of my careless action on the train and the problem of plastics in the ocean became horribly evident. With no other way of disposing of rubbish, the temptation, indeed, the default had become to simply throw bottles and bags on the ground or into the sea, river or lake and so much of this has ended up in the ocean. Since then I have been rigorous about waste and campaigned to make sure my local town has widely available recycling bins for all.

## IELTS speaking part 3 style questions

#### Examiner: What should be done about plastic in the ocean?

Emanuel: While quite a lot has been done already to highlight this terrible problem, I think more could be done to make sure the public know the dangers. Apparently around 350 million tonnes of plastic are being produced each year and around 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year.

If waste management practices don't improve, scientists predict this amount could increase tenfold by 2025. What happens is that while paper will eventually disintegrate, plastic does not do this and so when it does eventually break up, it still leaves smaller fragments called microplastics, which have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans.

#### Examiner: What might some solutions be to reduce this situation?

Alexi: I think many manufactures should work really hard to reduce the use of what is called single-use applications, plastics which are used just once and then disposed of as this makes up approximately half of all plastics. Plastic can quite easily be recycled and used again for shampoo bottles for example. Some large companies have already started only using recycled plastics for their own- brand products and this kind of policy should be rolled out as widely as possible.

#### Examiner: What would you say to children who are faced with this problem for the future?

Benji: I would try to encourage teachers and parents to explain the situation to youngsters but also to try and be positive about what can be done. Firstly, we all need to be much more careful about recycling which is not impossible and should start at school as well as in the home.

There have been many incredible documentaries informing us all about the global plastic problem and awareness is a very important stage in beginning to stop the problem. I am not sure what is being done at the moment to remove this mass of plastic but we must make sure we do not make this worse, and we protect our planet as well as the wildlife and birds and we should protect the next generation who will also have to try to find solutions.

## IELTS speaking part 1 - Style questions

#### Examiner:  Do you enjoy meeting new people?

Minna: Yes, I do, but I admit that it does depend on the context. For example, if I am with a group of life long friends as well, I feel more confident and relaxed than if I am alone, when I feel more timid and awkward.

I think that at work I try to put up a façade of being professional and in control although underneath the surface I am paddling like a swan.

#### Examiner: Would you describe yourself as a sociable person?

Mario: I’d like to say so, as I am always happy to get involved in organising parties and gatherings – indeed I can be a bit of a control freak, as I have an eye for detail. However, I would be more than delighted to be described as reliable and dependable as we all need friends we can rely on.

I have known my best friends since school, and we trust each other completely and pick up where we left off each time we see each other.

#### Examiner: Are you usually punctual or late?

Judy:  That’s a great question! Every year I make a resolution to be on time for both work and social meetings, but I have a terrible habit of always being slightly late.

I know that punctuality is a virtue and I am always embarrassed by being a bad time keeper, especially when I understand that being late is rude and disrespectful. I will keep working on improving this negative trait.

IELTS speaking part 2 - Style question
Describe a person you would like to be similar to. You should say

• Who this person is?

• What this person does?

• What qualities this person has and explain why you would like to be similar to this person?

Edin: I’d like to talk about a teacher who is Head of Pastoral care at a school I used to go to. Pastoral duties revolve around the mental and social health of students more than the academic side but of course, the two work in tandem.

This lady, Mrs Butler, has held this job for more than a decade, and she is inspiring in her attention to detail and caring personality.

It is her job to interact with students, in a relaxed, almost parental way and create the kind of atmosphere where they can trust her, and share any problems and issues they may have.

As part of her duties, she would liaise between the students and other members of staff, education, and healthcare professional bodies, and parents as needed.

The interpersonal and communication skills required for this role are very demanding  and take a long time to learn if not acquired naturally.

Mrs. Butler is enormously empathetic, she really understands emotion and is a great and generous listener and I believe these are all key qualities that are important to emulate.

I think that interacting with students and colleagues at work can present many challenges and an understanding of human characteristics, even the psychology, of how people think and respond to each other is more and more important.

I would love to be considered as caring, considerate, and reliable as she is and she is really one of those rare people who can connect with anyone, anywhere.

## IELTS speaking part 3 – Style question

#### Examiner:  How do you think the personalities of men and women vary?

Sergi: It is often said that men can be more opinionated and less empathetic than women and it is true that this is often a male stereotype.

However, compared to previous generations, many men today are more in touch with their feelings, less moody and are much more aware of the challenges faced by regarding juggling a family and parenthood.

#### Examiner: How do companies try to assess the personalities of people who are applying for jobs?

Alice: Rather than a traditional interview nowadays, many companies demand high grades in psychometric tests which have been designed to test character in order to select candidates who are compatible with the company mentality.

Whilst these tests may highlight insecure or weaker candidates, I am not convinced that it is the most effective way to judge personality.

#### Examiner: Why do you think they do this?

Aloic: In my opinion, these tests are used to save time as most jobs today attract numerous applicants and it must be hard to choose the strongest and most suitable.

That said, to be defined by an algorithm or computer program is terrifying and critics suggest that it cannot effectively determine those with good communication skills or natural leaders.

## IELTS speaking part 1 style questions

#### Examiner:  In what ways do you try to stay healthy?

Max:  I try to have a balanced diet as often as I can which means including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and I also  try exercise regularly – either running or going for a bike ride, but I admit that with all my studies at the moment, I am not always as conscientious about my health as I should be.

#### Examiner: Do you and your friends each much junk food?

Mario: I’d like to say no, as I am aware of how important it is to be healthy, and obviously junk foods  contain large amounts of salt and sugar to make it flavoursome and appealing to taste. However, as a student, I am often tempted by a quick and convenient take away, and in recent times, it’s been really useful to have ready meals delivered without having to leave home!

#### Examiner: What part of your lifestyle would you most like to make healthier?

Rose: That’s a hard question! Every year I make a resolution to do more exercise, to adopt healthier eating habits and to go to be earlier in order to be more effective and productive at work and when I study but this is much easier said than done.

I have recently taken up ballroom dancing with some colleagues from work, and this has given us the opportunity to keep fit, learn new skilful dance techniques, and have lots of fun simultaneously! I’d love to be as good as the dancers on Strictly Come Dancing which is a very popular TV show.

IELTS speaking part 2 style question
Describe a change you have made to benefit your own healthy lifestyle

You should say:

What it is
Why you decided to do it
How you have benefitted from it
and explain why you would recommend it to others
Diana: I have always been interested in Health, Diet and Nutrition as I am aware that this is extremely important to function successfully, sleep well and to prevent illness. I have been tempted by diets over the years, but my determination usually fluctuates quite a lot and they can be pretty boring, as well as rigorous. However, recently one of my flatmates adopted a vegan diet and, because we share a kitchen, I decided to be as broad minded as possible and learn from her!

There’s been a lot of stuff in the media about how unhealthy it is to eat too much meat, especially red meat and processed meat. I was already fairly healthy and ate a balanced diet, but when I started to read about veganism and the potential benefits of eating meat, I was hooked and determined to make some changes myself.

In fact, I recently watched a documentary on Netflix about a professional sportsman who was even more successful after becoming vegan, and this was revealing and surprising, as I had imagined that he would have needed vast quantities of meat to be strong. (note – grammar third conditional which is quite unusual!)

At first, the cooking was both time consuming and challenging, involving a vast range of new ingredients, techniques and recipe books, but it was fun at the same time, and our kitchen soon became a hub of not just friends but delicious odours!

After a few months, I decided to make this change and, whilst I do occasionally miss not enjoying a large steak, I feel healthier, have lost weight, feel energised and much more alert at work. I know too that have cut down my risk of serious disease such as a stroke or heart attack and this is reassuring.

I would definitely recommend cutting down on red meat and processed food to all my friends, even those who are rather sceptical about vegans and argue that this diet is too complicated and limited. We all know that the over production of meat is damaging to the environment and as an added bonus,  being partly vegan  has definitely saved me money as the price of meat has risen steadily  in price over the past few years.

## IELTS speaking part 3 style questions

#### Examiner: Do you think more could be done to encourage health in your country?

Edurne: I think, in my country that the policy makers should have more initiatives and implement stricter policies when it comes to activities that affect people’s health. For example, the banning of smoking in public places would not just benefit the smokers, but the non-smokers as well as there is much evidence about the dangers of passive smoking and air pollution. Also, there is a well-established link between better education and health care so education in school is important.

#### Examiner: How can individuals take more responsibility for their own health?

Andre: For me, this links back to education which should really start at school and then continue throughout one’s life. The more we look after ourselves and make the correct decisions surrounding food, health, exercise and so on, the less we might need from our overstretched health services and hospitals. 

For example, campaigns to eat less sugar, cut down on fizzy drinks and sugary snacks, and eat more fruit have been very successful recently and by educating the young, they, in turn, will influence their own families increase their vegetable and fruit intake.

#### Examiner: What could be done to halt the rise of obesity globally?

Raff: In my opinion the government has a huge responsibility to try to persuade people to live more healthily and the rise of obesity or overweight children as well as adults is very worrying. It is very distressing to see young children in pushchairs being given cans of fizzy drinks and sweets as a reward to good behaviour.

As well as education in school, governments could educate adults through as series of TV programmes, magazine adverts or public service education messages to raise awareness of the risk and dangers of obesity and a poor diet. A positive reinforcement message would be more effective than more negative messaging. For example, free gym membership, recipe cards and access to more playing fields, parks and green spaces which would contribute to making exercise not only accessible but fun too!
